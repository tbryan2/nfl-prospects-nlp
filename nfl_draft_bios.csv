"A physical specimen with a rare size-speed combination, Clowney was not as impactful as a junior while playing through injuries and being forced to deal with opposing offenses that fully accounted for him with extra chip protection. Was a 20-year-old junior affected by turnover on the defensive coaching staff. Could benefit tremendously from a stable positional coach and strong, veteran mentor on the defensive line who will hold him accountable, show him the way and serve as a fatherly figure. Is one of the most unique talents in the draft and could easily be a double-digit sack producer in the pros from either end. Is every bit worthy of the first overall pick -- will immediately upgrade a defensive line and improve the production of those around him.",7.50
"A legitimate No. 1-caliber receiver who stepped onto the field as a true freshman and made an immediate, game-changing impact. Was slowed by injuries as a sophomore, but responded with a strong junior season and capped his career as one of the most impactful receivers in school history. Has rare speed, soft hands and the big-play ability to challenge NFL defensive backs as a rookie. A top-10 cinch.",7.10
"A highly disruptive, athletic specimen with the pass-rush potential to effortlessly emerge as a double-digit sack producer. Is far from a finished product and his best football is still ahead of him, yet he plays the game with more of an offensive temperament and could require some patience. Is the type of rare athlete that could even contribute as an offensive playmaker once he learns to grasp defensive concepts and the game slows down for him. A top-10 talent.",7.00
"A havoc-wreaking rush linebacker with the burst and acceleration to excel as a right defensive end in a ""40"" front, Mack has demonstrated the instincts, toughness, athletic ability and explosive power to line up at any linebacker position in an even or odd front and factor readily. Is a four-year starter who made an immediate impact upon his arrival and is well primed for the NFL game. Looks every bit the part, comes from a humble, grounded family and offers the full package to become an impact performer in the pros.",7.00
"Smart, tough, versatile franchise left tackle capable of playing all five positions on the line. Can plug into a starting lineup immediately and will play a long time at a consistently high level. One of the safest picks in the draft, Matthews' best position might even be center.",7.00
"Smart, instinctive, fast-flowing, every-down linebacker capable of manning any position in a ""40"" front or steering a defense from the weak side in a ""30"" front, where he starred for a national-championship defense as a junior and carried the Tide as a senior. Has the football temperament, desire and work habits to emerge as a tackling machine in the pros. Has Pro Bowl potential.",7.00
"Big, strong, athletic, overpowering left tackle with the raw potential to become a premiere, franchise left tackle. Is only a third-year sophomore and two-year starter and still must improve his hand use, footwork and technique. However, he is undeniably gifted and capable of walking into a starting-left-tackle job in the pros and paving the way in the run game.",7.00
"A monster-sized, intimidating, big-play receiver, Benjamin has the overall strength, length and wide catching radius that will demand extra coverage be rolled his way. Showed continual improvement, is still growing into the position, and possesses the traits to become a legitimate No. 1 receiver. A very intriguing mismatch weapon with ascending talent.",6.80
"Big, athletic, ascending quarterback with enough arm talent and intangibles to develop into a franchise starter. Is not yet a finished product and scouts' opinions vary on his ceiling, but elements of Bortles’ skill set compare to some of the best in the game today, and his best football is ahead of him.",6.80
"A calculated, football-smart, precision-matchup rhythm passer, Bridgewater would be best suited entering a warm-weather or dome environment such as those most common in the South divisions. Would stand to benefit heavily from operating a short, dink-and-dunk rhythm passing game. Compensates for a lack of elite arm talent and prototype measureables with the intangibles and football intelligence that could elevate the other 52 players around him. Instinctive passer with the laser-beam determination to become a Pro Bowl-caliber passer in the right system.",6.80
"Highly athletic, highly productive ""F"" tight end dripping with upside and mismatch capability. Ebron might not be in the ""freak"" category, but his speed, movement skills, hands and run-after-catch skill puts him in the next tier, as he has ample ability to be a playmaker at the next level.",6.80
NA,NA
"A big, fast, athletic, man-cover corner capable of locking down receivers and creating big plays in the return game. Is the most physically gifted cover man in this year's draft and has the athletic talent to walk into a starting job and match up with big receivers from Day One if he continues to work at his craft after a big payday and prepares like a pro.",6.80
"Hulking, long-armed, physically gifted defensive lineman with desirable size, strength, athleticism and versatility to appeal as a five-technique or as a defensive tackle or base end in a 4-3. Was not in peak condition for his junior season, but has disruptive upside.",6.80
"Lean, athletic, physical, instinctive free safety with starter-caliber range, coverage skills and tackling ability. Was not an omnipresent ballhawk or violent eraser, but should step into a starting role right away and solidify the position.",6.70
"A prep hoopster with shooting-guard size, Evans combined with Johnny Manziel to form one of the most dominant quarterback-receiver connections in the nation the last two seasons. He’s a big, physical, strong-handed, West Coast possession receiver with playmaking ability who projects as a No. 2 in the pros where he will make his money as a chain mover and red-zone target.",6.70
"A raw, converted tight end with a basketball background, Hageman is a big, athletic, finesse three-technique with intriguing dimensions and movement skills who fits best in an aggressive, one-gap scheme where he could fire into gaps. Will probably be restricted to nickel pass-rush duty initially until the game slows down for him, but has impact potential if he ever figures it out. Is still maturing, having endured a harrowing childhood to get to where he is today, and would be best served landing in a structured environment with veteran mentorship. Classic boom-or-bust prospect.",6.70
"A big, strong, powerful, NFL feature back who carried the Buckeyes' offense as a senior and proved he can be a workhorse. Solid all-around, chunk runner well-built for the physicality of the AFC North.",6.70
"A loose, explosive, long-limbed athlete, Lawrence consistently pressurizes the edge and harasses quarterbacks. His pass-rushing ability rates among the best in this year’s class, and he holds mass appeal. Lacks ideal stoutness at the point of attack, but could thrive as a 4-3 right end or 3-4 rush linebacker, and should contribute readily on passing downs.",6.70
"An extremely motivated, dynamic, playmaking receiver, Lee's junior season was plagued by shoulder, knee and leg injuries and a revolving door at head coach, where he cycled through three. Showed all the traits desired in a No. 1 receiver early in his career and has overcome a lot of adversity in his life to get to this point.",6.70
"An experienced, finesse left tackle with the length, agility and temperament to hold down a starting job for a long time. Is nuanced in pass protection and would fit best in a slide-lateral movement, bucket-stepping, zone-based blocking scheme. Similar in mold to Patriots 2011 17th overall selection Nate Solder.",6.70
"A big, physical, hammering run defender brings an enforcer mentality to the box and an intimidating, punishing presence to the back end. Is arguably the most violent hitter in this year's draft class and should make his presence felt readily in the pros.",6.70
"Smallish, quick-twitch, speedy, physical cornerback with an intriguing combination of urgent athleticism, ball skills, tackling ability and scheme versatility. Appeals to zone and man teams, should be able to contribute readily as nickel slot defender and special-teams contributor and has a ceiling as a No. 2.",6.70
"The Big Ten's leading tackler, Shazier flies around the field and his unique athletic ability stands out. Offers a tremendous combination of speed, tackling and coverage skills to become a playmaker as a run-and-hit 4-3 Will or perhaps a 3-4 weakside 'backer if protected by a block-occupying nose tackle. Value is increased by the fact that he will not have to come off the field.",6.70
"A long-limbed, sure-handed possession receiver with starter-caliber, positional traits. Lacks top-end speed and strength. As a 21-year-old, third-year sophomore entering the draft early, is still growing into his body and developing core strength. A poor man's Michael Crabtree, Adams possesses very intriguing upside to be groomed.",6.40
"Talented, competitive, productive, inconsistent college split end who projects as a flanker or slot receiver in the pros, where a creative offensive coordinator can take advantage of his run-after-catch skills. Could be a productive No. 3 option with added value as a kick returner.",6.40
"Big, strong, athletic, instinctive press-man corner who elevated his game as a senior. Is deceptively fast and has the desirable size to match up with big receivers.",6.40
"Big, thickly built, relatively polished blocker who brings a steadying presence to the interior offensive line. Dependability and effectiveness blocking for pass and run combined with sterling intangibles, including football intelligence, make him capable of starting as a rookie and holding down a position for years to come.",6.40
"A very unique, run-around, ad-lib, sandlot-style quarterback who consistently won games playing a brand of fast-paced, jailbreak football that often goes off script and can be difficult both to game plan with and against. Is most comfortable on the move outside the pocket where he can find open throwing lanes and see the field and will command mush rush and extra spy defenders. Has defied the odds and proven to be a great college-system quarterback, but still must prove he is willing to work to be great, adjust his hard-partying, Hollywood lifestyle and be able to inspire his teammates by more than his playmaking ability. Overall character, leadership ability and work habits will define his NFL career. Rare competitiveness and third-down efficiency could carry him a long way, yet he will be challenged to avoid a Ryan Leaf-like, crash-and-burn scenario if he does not settle down and mature. A high-risk, high-reward pick, Manziel stands to benefit from entering the NFL at a time when moving pockets are trending.",6.40
"Athletic, smart, competitive, dependable college left tackle whose length dictates a move inside, where he has plug-and-play ability in a zone-blocking scheme. One of the cleanest prospects in this year’s draft.",6.40
"Despite standing to benefit from a more dominant senior season in South Bend, Nix, who already graduated, opted to forgo his final year of eligibility in order to provide for 13 siblings. He does not enter the NFL with momentum, having coped with knee tendinitis before season-ending surgery to repair a torn left meniscus, and too often his gregarious personality and media hype overshadowed his performance. However, if the massive interior defender taps into his power more consistently, Nix has ample mass, strength and athleticism to anchor a ""30"" front as a space-eating, block-occupying run stuffer.",6.40
"Athletic, tough, instinctive, strong-armed, highly competitive quarterback who will impress in workouts, interviews and on the board. Elevated the Fresno State program and profiles like a gunslinger, though he’d be better served in the long run honing his game-management skills. Will be a starter sooner rather than later and the degree to which he’s able to make those around him better will determine his ceiling.",6.30
"Short, speedy, nifty-footed receiver who was unaffected by the departure of Steelers 2013 third-rounder Markus Wheaton, establishing himself as a playmaker in his own right by leading the nation with 133 yards per contest as a junior. Projects as a useful slot receiver with run-after-catch ability and some utility as an outside receiver.",6.30
"Big, thickly built, athletic slasher with an overinflated sense of his abilities and character red flags, which could cause some teams to shy away. Fits best in a downhill scheme and has potential to be a 20-carry back in the NFL, but must run to his size more consistently and prove his unstable behavior is a thing of the past.",6.30
"Big, physically gifted “X” receiver with deep speed, “above-the-rim” potential and playmaking ability. Has a ceiling as a No. 1 or No. 2 in a vertical passing offense, and his best football is in front him. Likely to elevate his stock at the combine and in workouts.",6.30
"Highly productive, hard-charging slasher who runs more competitively than he does powerfully and picks up yardage in chunks. Has some first-round traits and is one of the most instinctive runners in this year's draft class, though his stock could be affected by off-the-field troubles.",6.20
"Big, athletic, ascending, pass-rush talent with the size, burst and flexibility to pressurize the edge as a right defensive end. Is not a finished product, particularly as a run defender, but should only become more disruptive as his strength, technique and savvy catch up with his natural physical ability. Could also draw looks as a 3-4 rush linebacker.",6.20
"Fast, rangy, tough, loquacious defensive back who was miscast as a safety in his senior season, but projects best as a cornerback in the pros where his explosiveness and physicality will appeal to a wide range of teams. Should contribute readily on special teams and has eventual starter potential. Played his best football early in the season and tapered off late in the year.",6.20
"Big, strong, heavy pass protector with good balance, anchor strength and hand use to handle power and speed. Does not affect the run game the same way and almost appears more destined for the left side in the pros. Has instant-starter potential.",6.20
"Big, strong-bodied interior force who shed weight and improved his stamina as a senior, displaying NFL-caliber physicality in the trenches. Has been inconsistent in the past, but if the light has come on, Jones' combination of size, power and movement enables him to play as a 4-3 one-technique or 3-4 five-technique.",6.20
"Massive, long-limbed, inconsistent, overhyped college left tackle whose sheer dimensions, raw tools and high ceiling are far more appealing than his snap-to-snap performance at this stage of his development. Has enough length and anchor strength to survive on the left side, though he will never be a dancing bear, and he projects more ideally as a bulldozing right tackle in a power scheme.",6.20
"The SEC Player of the Year, Mason is a compactly built, nifty-footed runner with a balanced skill set to merit 20 touches per game at the next level. Fits in multiple schemes and has the chops to make an impact as a rookie.",6.20
NA,NA
"An efficient game-managing quarterback who has shown he can carry an offense at times throughout his career, but more often is dependent on a terrific supporting cast. Grades out most highly for his intangibles and decision-making, knowing when and where to go with the ball, and could earn an NFL starting job.",6.20
"A big-bodied, short-area plugger with some underachiever traits, McCullers has raw tools that could become special if he learns to harness the innate strength in his body and pairs with a DL coach who can refine his mechanics.",6.20
"As a base end in an even front or a LOLB in an odd front, Murphy's instincts, motor and toughness are what define his success and could allow him to eventually become a double-digit sack producer in the pros. Will require a few years to adapt to the speed of the NFL game.",6.20
"A converted DE/OLB who emerged from the shadow of Bengals 2013 first-rounder Tyler Eifert, Niklas is the latest in a line of NFL tight ends produced by Notre Dame. He boasts an intriguing combination of size, athleticism, receiving ability and blocking ability to develop into a bona fide, balanced, No. 1 tight end. Has played tight end for just two years and arrow is pointing up.",6.20
"Good functional football player who capped his college career with a game-changing MVP performance in the Hawaii Bowl, where he returned two fumble recoveries for touchdowns. Has starter-quality physical traits and the positional skill to contribute readily in the pros. An underrated clingy cover man with a natural feel for the game.",6.20
"The Big Ten's leading receiver the last two seasons, Robinson is a big, fluid, outside receiver with a nice combination of ""above-the-rim"" prowess and run-after-catch ability. Offers possession skills, playmaking ability and red-zone utility to develop into a solid No. 2 option.",6.20
NA,NA
"Long-framed, long-armed, prototype five-technique capable of kicking inside and manning the nose. Very impressive strength and power. Can play anywhere along a ""30"" front. An underrated cog in a defense, Stinson could play a long time in the league and may never receive his due outside the building.",6.20
"Does not look the part and was miscast when forced to play left tackle for the Bruins, but Su’a-Filo is more effective than he is pretty. Projects best at left guard, where he has starter-caliber ability in a power scheme, though he is athletic enough to appeal to zone teams, too.",6.20
"A tough, scrappy, undersized nickel back with potential to emerge as a No. 2 corner, Verrett's body is not ideally built to withstand the rigors of a starting job. An outstanding football player in the mold of feisty Titans 2006 seventh-round pick Cortland Finnegan.",6.20
"Georgia Tech’s all-time sack leader, Attaochu is a Nigerian-born, young, heady, disruptive, relentless edge rusher who profiles as 3-4 right outside linebacker. Should interview well, and has the look of a trustworthy, long-term starter given his pass-rush ability, motor and makeup.",6.10
"An undersized college left tackle who projects best to the inside in the pros. Displays the tenacity, leg drive and mean streak that is highly coveted by OL coaches and could drive up his draft status. Could require some initial patience moving inside, yet possesses the skill set, intelligence and desire to successfully convert.",6.10
"Short, active, athletic, instinctive tackling machine who will have to overcome physical limitations to establish himself as a dependable, long-term starter, though he has immediate special-teams ability and the makeup to push for a more prominent role.",6.10
"Very lean, rangy, athletic cover man who shows up well in run support and has good length to match up with big receivers. Will require technique refinement, but has an aggressive playing temperament that will appeal to coaches and moldable tools to develop.",6.10
"Athletic, raw, developmental three-technique with clear upside, though he is inexperienced, aimless and unrefined at this stage of his development. Needs more glass in his diet and simply does not impact games the way he should. Is likely to test well and be drafted higher than his performance dictates in the hopes a defensive line coach can tap into his potential.",6.10
"Big-framed, linear and dependable, Fiedorowicz looks the part and has balanced skills to be a legitimate “Y” tight end in the pros. Is an asset as a competitive blocker and as a sure-handed receiver. Will be in demand in a relatively thin tight ends class.",6.10
"Compactly built, downhill slasher with the agility and balanced skill set to emerge as a workhorse back. Earned the top assignment in a very talented backfield and has a similar build, running style and all-around utility as San Francisco 49ers 2005 third-round pick Frank Gore. Could prove to be a better pro than college player.",6.10
"Massive, strong-bodied, long-armed specimen with the physical gifts to be a dominant NFL right tackle in a power or slide-protection blocking scheme. However, he failed to live up to expectations in Coral Cables thanks to a tumultuous career marred by tragedy, suspensions, injuries and benchings. High-risk, high-reward, high-maintenance wild card who must convince decision-makers he’s worth gambling on. Interview process will go a long way in determining his trustworthiness.",6.10
"Slightly undersized, stoutly built, country-strong run stopper with the ability to drop anchor inside an odd front and develop into a solid, 3-4 movement nose tackle. Strength is his calling card despite his relatively modest size.",6.10
"Big, athletic, overhyped defensive tackle who shows in flashes, but leaves evaluators wanting more and would have benefited from a more dominant junior season. Fits best in an even front, though he’s not instant coffee, as his tweener skill set is too unrefined to project absolutely as a nose or three-technique. Will test well but draw varied opinions, and has the look of a boom-or-bust prospect.",6.10
"Polished, quarterback-friendly, sure-handed possession receiver with a flare for the highlight-reel catch. Could be an effective No. 3 option, capable of lining up as a ""Z"" or slot, working short-to-intermediate and beating zone coverage.",6.10
"A big, hard-hitting, vocal secondary leader who showed better as a junior lining up along a more talented secondary next to Eric Reid than he did as a senior. However, still possesses starter-caliber traits as an interchangeable safety most ideally suited playing in the box.",6.10
"Outstanding-sized, barrel-chested finesse pivot with center-guard versatility. Grades out highly as a position-sustain blocker and possesses untappped strength and power in his body. Lacks desirable grit, toughness and finishing strength to maximize his talent and is stronger than he plays. Has instant-starter potential as a center or right guard, but could stand to benefit from some time to be groomed.",6.10
"A relative of Jerry Rice, Matthews departs Vanderbilt as the most productive pass catcher in SEC history. He’s a tall, narrow-framed, West Coast possession receiver with soft hands, a professional approach and the versatility to line up inside or outside and become a solid No. 2 or No. 3. High-floor prospect whose timed speed could dictate his ultimate draft value.",6.10
"Thickly built, physical, highly competitive lineman who manned left tackle competently in college, but is better suited for the right side in the pros. Has starter-caliber strength, athleticism and technique supplemented with desirable intangibles. Versatility to play guard or left tackle in a pinch adds to value.",6.10
"An intriguing height-weight-speed prospect, Seferian-Jenkins has all the tools to be a legitimate No. 1 tight end in the NFL, though he has to maintain focus and consistency and continue improving as a blocker.",6.10
"Bulked up and added a lot of bad weight as a senior, negating his initial burst and diminishing his production, yet still showed good quickness off the ball. Played at a more natural weight and was noticeably a step quicker in 2012. Fits best as an under tackle in an even front and would be best playing close to 290 pounds.",6.10
"Experienced, dependable pivot who lacks starter-caliber power and athleticism. Lack of versatility hurts his chances, and he will have to survive on smarts, leadership and competitiveness.",6.10
"Underpowered, quick-footed, scrappy,  zone blocker with the smarts, movement skill and competitive zeal to emerge as a very efficient pro. Displays the quickness highly desired at the pivot and might prove to be best at center.",6.10
"Good-sized, athletic, smooth-moving stand-up player who projects best as a 3-4 right outside linebacker, but could also warrant consideration from 4-3 teams as a Will or Sam. Is not without flaws, but has unique ability to play up the field, laterally or in reverse.",6.10
"Very strong, stocky, powerful runner with the instincts, contact balance and toughness to carry a heavy workload. Really emerged as a senior, when he led the nation in rushing, and proved worthy of a starting role.",6.10
"Highly productive, finesse, detached tight end who racked up 106 receptions for 1,352 yards (12.8) and seven TDs as a junior when he was essentially an inside receiver for the Red Raiders. Will have to play a similar role in the pros, as he is not equipped to survive in-line.",5.90
Explosive playmaker lacking requisite size for the pro game. Was slowed by an ankle injury early and did not return to junior form until late in senior season. Can make an immediate impact in the return game and add value as a multipurpose threat. Long-term durability is greatest concern given tiny frame.,5.90
"Undersized, athletic, run-around see-and-go reactor who needs to be protected to be effective. Projects as a Will linebacker, nickel defender and special-teams contributor.",5.90
"Difficult to prepare for and difficult to block, Boyd is a short, athletic, strong-armed quarterback with Wildcat value and starter potential in a vertical-power system, though he is the type you look to replace. The success of Russell Wilson likely helps Boyd’s cause, but he is not as polished and might be better suited as a backup.",5.90
"Aggressive, high-collision 'Mike' linebacker best paired with a demanding position coach who will extract the most from him.",5.90
"Smoother-than-explosive, height-weight-speed prospect who will draw the attention of Cover-2 teams given his physicality, ball skills and tackling. Special-teams ability adds to value.",5.90
"Good-sized, smart, ballhawking zone corner who plays fast and could bring immediate value as a nickel back and contribute on special teams.",5.90
"A very big, strong, two-gapping plugger ideally suited to stack the corner of an odd front. Will make a living digging his feet in the dirt and defending the run.",5.90
"Big, tall, talented, West Coast receiver whose sheer size enables him to be effective outside the numbers, on slant routes and in the red zone, though inconsistency has prevented him from reaching his potential. Has the look of a No. 2 receiver, but his production fell off as a junior (played through a knee injury). He could have used another season to polish his skills.",5.90
"Strong, athletic, raw defensive end prospect who would have been better served returning for his senior season. Despite being rough around the edges at this stage of his development, Crichton shows in flashes and has power potential as a 4-3 defensive end. Could require patience.",5.90
"Short, scrappy, instinctive, highly productive defensive lineman who does not look the part, but inspires confidence he can be an exception to the rule. Is the type you root for and has the quickness, athleticism and motor to earn a spot as a rotational three-technique in a fast-flowing 4-3 scheme.",5.90
"Small-school college left tackle best suited to kick inside in the pros. Has the girth and enough athletic ability to compete as a guard or center and ornery football disposition desired in the trenches. A tough, gritty, road grader capable of paving the way in the run game, Dozier will require some technique refinement in pass protection, yet possesses clear starter potential with continued development. Draft status could ascend if he proves he can play center.",5.90
"Tough, gritty, smart battler who transformed from an impactful 250-pound three-technique as a freshman. Made a successful conversion to left tackle as a sophomore and has grown to be a dominating Canadian 315-pound left tackle expected to be the first pick of the CFL draft. Projects best inside in the pros and could prove to be the best product delivered from Canada's developmental system since Israel Idonije. Will require refinement, but has the physical tools and temperament that cannot be taught.",5.90
"A two-sport athlete who has already graduated, Ellington opted to forgo basketball and his senior football season to enter the draft. While he lacks desirable height and might not be an elite tester, Ellington brings explosiveness, hands and playmaking ability to the slot. Arrow is pointing up, and his desirable intangibles inspire confidence he'll reach his potential, especially now that he's able to focus solely on football.",5.90
"A big, strong cornerback who must prove that he can recover from offseason knee surgery and return to being the player he was as a junior, when he graded out highly in press coverage, as a tackler and for his ability to make plays on the ball. Has a unique combination of size and speed.",5.90
"High-motor college left defensive end better suited for a rush linebacker role in the pros. Has added more than 50 pounds to his frame since arriving on campus and has demonstrated the desire, work habits and competitiveness to develop into a Trent Cole-like edge rusher if he can stay healthy.",5.90
"Narrow-framed, confident, competitive off-man/zone corner who should contribute readily on special teams while pushing for a role in sub packages.",5.90
"A decorated, FCS passer, Garoppolo could excite quarterback coaches with his quick delivery, mental make-up and work habits, yet he still needs to prove he can fit the ball into tight windows and do more than carve up soft shells the way he regularly did on his way to a record-breaking performance in college. Possesses the physical tools to eventually earn an NFL starting job in a rhythm passing game with continued refinement, but is more of a caretaker than a game changer and will require some patience adapting to the NFL game.",5.90
"A long-bodied, athletic rush linebacker with the base strength desired in a 4-3 left defensive end, Hubbard's greatest physical trait is his core functional strength and ability to leverage the edge and defend the run. Is still developing as a pass rusher and offers the scheme versatility and upside to interest any defense. Has starter traits, but has yet to reach the impact level he thinks he makes. Has upside if the light bulb comes on.",5.90
"A wide-bodied, overachieving, college left tackle more ideally suited for the right side in the pros. Is football smart, gritty and competitive enough to eventually enter a starting lineup, but would be an ideal backup swing tackle on a strong offensive line and might even benefit from kicking inside where he'd have help on each side.",5.90
"Athletic, smooth-moving, polished receiver who runs crisp routes, has terrific hands and boasts NFL bloodlines. Balanced skill set, dependability and versatility will be valued at the next level, where he could be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 receiver in a sophisticated passing system. Arrow pointing up.",5.90
"Very active, high-motor, steady, consistent producer. Lacks ideal bulk for the inside and speed to work the edges, but can set the edge and bring value to an odd front in a LOLB role or as a Sam linebacker. Is most natural moving forward piercing gaps. Will need to be managed, needs to cut down on errors and must learn to play within the structure of the defense.",5.90
"Big, athletic, press-man corner who can excite scouts when they get an up-close look at his movement skills. However, he has a junior-college background, does not play to his size and will need to be managed closely to maximize his talent. Appears destined for Pete Carroll's defense.",5.90
"Powell is a physically gifted, inconsistent, college “Buck” (hybrid defensive end/outside linebacker) with crude strength and athleticism. Has developmental value as a stand-up rush linebacker, but must dedicate himself to the craft and realize he’s no longer the big man on campus.",5.90
"Thickly built, long-armed, talented defensive tackle who was not as consistently dominant as his numbers or accolades suggest. Has quickness, strength and enough pass-rush ability to develop into a rotational three-technique in the pros, but could have benefited from another year of SEC competition.",5.90
"A country-strong, throwback, wrangler cowboy with the toughness desired to set the edge and the motor, intensity and competitiveness to produce effort sacks. Can factor as a 3-4 rush linebacker in an odd front or match up with tight ends as a strong-side linebacker in an even front. Could contribute readily as a situational rusher and, with continued strength gains, emerge as a DE prospect. Versatility is a plus.",5.90
"Massive road grader with grown-man strength which enables him to reestablish the line of scrimmage in the run game and thwart the rush. Versatility to play right tackle adds to value and he has plug-and-play capability in a power scheme, though bust factor cannot be ignored.",5.90
"Lean, athletic, finesse cornerback who did not elevate his game in 2013 when injuries, suspension and inconsistency marred his junior season. Is best deployed in off-man or zone and could develop into a No. 2 or No. 3 corner if he regains his sophomore form, though he lacks desirable instincts and tackling ability.",5.90
"Athletic, competitive, tough, upright slasher who is an asset as a receiver -- hands rate among the best on a RB in recent years. Cannot project as a bellcow, but offers playmaking ability as part of a tandem in a zone scheme. Speed and durability could determine ultimate draft value.",5.90
"Productive college middle linebacker at his best when he’s kept clean or has a clear path. Projects best in a 4-3, where he has enough athleticism and functionality in coverage to play in the middle or on the weak side. Has starter-caliber potential, but might be the type you look to replace.",5.90
"A high school quarterback turned pass rusher who broke out with 14.5 sacks as a senior (1.12 sacks-per-game average led nation), Smith projects as a pass-rushing, 3-4 right outside linebacker in the pros. Should contribute initially on passing downs and has eventual starter potential as his game becomes more well-rounded.",5.90
"Big, athletic, raw interior defender with underachiever traits who had a fairly nondescript career at UConn, but has crude physical tools for a defensive line coach to mold. Developmental prospect who potentially fits in a 4-3 or as a 3-4 five-technique.",5.90
"Strong-bodied, dependable gap blocker who played left tackle in college but will likely slide inside in the pros. Showed improvement as a senior and has the potential to be a long-term fixture at left guard. Ability to play tackle in a pinch adds to value.",5.90
"A deluxe, specialty back and potential slot receiver with game-breaking return ability, Thomas can be an explosive mismatch weapon in multiple facets of the game.  Diminutive stature will decrease the odds he'll be able to stay healthy in the pros, and his commitment to the game will dictate his future success. Rare speed creates a higher commodity on Draft Day.",5.90
"Unrefined, strong-armed, sturdy pocket passer who looks the part and has intriguing, raw arm talent, though he is a converted tight end whose inexperience showed throughout a yo-yo career in Blacksburg. Has definite developmental value given his starter-caliber skill set and intangible makeup. Would benefit from coaching continuity, more specifically a QB coach capable of refining his crude talent.",5.90
"A very smart, pedigreed, rangy free safety with the athletic ability and cover skill desired on the back end. Lack of size and tackling strength could leave much to be desired when defending the run. Top-notch intangibles -- toughness, instincts, competitiveness and leadership ability -- should allow him to quickly emerge as a defensive leader and enhance his draft status.",5.90
"Good-sized, physical, competitive, bump-and-steer technician with starter-caliber ability in multiple schemes. Has a desirable temperament for the position and is a projectable, low-risk prospect.",5.90
"Good-sized, compactly built, highly productive, physical workhorse and program-changer who took Towson to new heights while dominating inferior competition. Has the chops to factor prominently in a power-running scheme, showing the ability to slash and cut, run over defenders and contribute as a receiver.",5.90
"Big, physical, smart, serviceable offensive guard who will not score many style points, but generally gets the job done. Has starter-caliber ability and fits best in a power scheme that takes advantage of his size and pulling ability.",5.90
"A former walk-on, Abbrederis went from afterthought to scholarship player to No. 1 receiver. While the blue-collar overachiever lacks exceptional athletic traits for the NFL, he's a steady ""X"" receiver whose hands and smarts could enable him to work his way into a No. 3 or No. 4 receiver role.",5.80
"Classic tweener whose best shot in the pros could come as a nickel safety/linebacker, where he could maximize his ball skills and be deployed to blitz. Could make his biggest mark on special teams.",5.80
"A big, well-built inside runner with soft hands, Baker must learn how to protect the ball better to earn his way in the big leagues. However, he possesses the physical traits to earn a role with continued focus and development.",5.80
NA,NA
"A long-limbed, rangy back-half defender with intriguing straight-line speed, range and leaping ability to compete for a job as a backup safety and special teams performer. Has intriguing physical tools to be molded if he bows up.",5.80
NA,NA
"A tough, productive, stand-up rush linebacker who might not look pretty, but consistently gets the job done. Came through in clutch situations and displayed a knack for making timely and game-changing big plays.",5.80
"Smooth, productive nickel corner more proficent vs. the pass than run. Benwikere's game lacks physicality, yet his zone cover skills could allow him to carve a role in the slot and on special teams. Needs to be challenged to maximize his potential and would benefit from a demanding positional coach.",5.80
"Compactly built, highly competitive, active, energetic safety with a mixture of strong and free safety traits. Profiles like a solid backup and core special-teamer with makeup to push for a more prominent role.",5.80
"Blue looks the part and would have been the No. 1 back at most schools given his combination of size, speed, power and competitiveness. Is a second-round talent on physical ability alone, but injury and a stacked stable of LSU runners limited Blue’s opportunity to shine. Scheme-versatile runner who is a prime candidate to elevate his stock prior to the draft and be a far more productive pro than college player.",5.80
"A top-heavy, barrel-chested, thick-bodied, short-area blocker, Bodine plays with a gritty football demeanor. Swing-interior versatility adds to his value.",5.80
"Big, slender, West Coast, short-to-intermediate possession receiver who could compete for a job as a No. 4 or No. 5. Having sat the year out, Boyd’s performance at the combine and in workouts will determine draft standing.",5.80
"An undersized college defensive end, Bradford projects to outside linebacker in a 3-4 front in the pros, where his physical dimensions and rush ability are best suited. Would profile best in an aggressive, one-gapping odd front such as the Colts, Jets, Ravens or Steelers.",5.80
"Well-built, inconsistent interior defender with enough strength, athleticism and pass-rush ability to contribute in a rotational role. Best fits as a 4-3 defensive tackle, but could appeal to teams running a hybrid scheme given his potential to be used as a five-technique.",5.80
"Lean, athletic, long-limbed hybrid safety with an appealing combination of fluidity, range and physicality. Versatile defender who can be deployed over the top as a “robber” or in the box. Has starter-caliber ability if he if he’s able to shore up his tackling and become a more productive on-the-ball defender, but at worst should be a solid backup and core special-teams player.",5.80
"Undersized, athletic, finesse, inconsistent Will linebacker who needs to be kept clean to be effective. Small frame, deficient instincts and soft run defense likely relegate him to a backup role, and he will have to excel on special teams.",5.80
"A lean, long-limbed, rangy, outside-the-numbers, big-play receiver, Bryant declared for the draft early with underclassmen nipping at his playing time late in the season. Will require additional seasoning to make a mark in the pro game. A better tester than football player at this stage of his development.",5.80
"Although he's built like a cornerback, Bucannon's style of play makes it easy to identify him as a tone-setting strong safety. Has coverage limitations, but brings the aggressiveness and physicality to carve a niche as a downhill box defender and core special-teams player.",5.80
"Big, tough, experienced, durable, competitive Mike linebacker who was a heart-and-soul type for the stingiest defense in college football. Like a coach on the field, Bullough is a throwback talent whose instincts and technique will have to compensate for athletic limitations for him to win a starting role.",5.80
"Quicker-than-fast, short-striding slot receiver and sudden punt returner with the competiveness and swagger desired to earn a role in multiple phases. Is crafty, fiery and tough enough to make it.",5.80
"A savvy, athletic, undersized H-back who was utilized in a flexed receiving role in the Gators' offense. Has the athletic traits to earn a living working detached out of the slot as an 'F' tight end. Can offer a creative offensive coordinator a versatile jack-of-all-trades gimmick weapon.",5.80
"An athletic, undersized, multi-threat, option college quarterback who shared time in the slot, Colter displayed the playmaking ability, short-area burst, creativity and hands to become a Danny Amendola-type slot receiver and should be able to factor readily in the pros once he commits full-time to the position. Offers situational Wildcat quarterbacking capability and return ability with traits that project very well as a punt returner. Postseason ankle surgery will limit his spring workouts and could dip his draft standing.",5.80
"Long, smart, tough, zone corner whose body is not built to withstand heavy contact or the aggression with which he likes to play. Will grow on evaluators the more they watch him and has the instincts to eventually compete for a starting job, though teams could always be looking to upgrade his lack of speed and athletic ability. Torn ACL injury suffered at the Senior Bowl will affect his readiness for the season and could drop his draft status by a round or two.",5.80
"A compact, physical zone corner with intriguing return skill, Davis will be more challenged by his lack of height and tight hips in the pros. His intangibles, toughness against the run and ability to factor as a punt returner will allow him to carve out a role.",5.80
"A big, long, athletic receiver with inconsistent hands and questionable toughness and effort. Displays starter-caliber physical traits, yet his playing demeanor and approach turn off many evaluators and could force his draft status to sink. Is at his best outside the numbers as an ""X"" receiver.",5.80
"Exceptional-sized, Division II standout with the size, ball skills and anticipation to earn a job as a zone cover man. Has the physical traits to pique the interest of Seattle, Jacksonville and Tampa Bay.",5.80
"Box safety possessing the physical talent to compete in the NFL and even earn a starting job eventually if he can stay focused, commit to a playbook and hone his eyes. Should be able to factor readily on special teams. Coverage limitations will leave him vulnerable and would be best in a very simple scheme.",5.80
"Lean, long-levered, smooth-muscled, finesse free safety with speed and range, though he’s more interested in hitting than securing tackles -- he does not provide dependability desired on the back end.",5.80
"Stood out in the College All-Star Bowl, when he earned MVP honors scoring the game's only touchdown on a 30-yard interception return and followed it up with an exceptional pro day performance that create the opportunity to compete for a job in sub-packages immediately in the pros. A late-riser with physical tools that could allow him to be a better pro than college player.",5.80
NA,NA
"Undersized, explosive, athletic, high-motor three-technique whose junior season was cut short in Week 3 by a knee injury. Injury history will likely affect his draft stock, but when healthy, he shows the ability to disrupt the backfield and pressure the quarterback. Fits best in an aggressive scheme in which he could use his quickness to slant, stunt and shoot gaps.",5.80
"Good-sized, sure-handed possession receiver with the toughness to work through the middle and catch in a crowd. Can make a living as a zone-beating, move-the-chains target.",5.80
"Big, thickly built, experienced right tackle who graduated with a degree in aeronautics and astronautics and entered the draft early despite standing to benefit from another year of seasoning on The Farm. Has size and smarts to stick in a power/slide-protection scheme, but needs to make strides with his functional strength, technique and aggressiveness. Could be tried inside.",5.80
"A better athlete than football player at this stage of his development, Fortt transferred from Penn State and played only one season at Cal before making a premature jump to the NFL. Speedy, finesse, see-and-go reactor who looks the part and has intriguing, starter-caliber athleticism to fit on the weak side in a fast-flowing 4-3 where he’s freed up to chase the ball. Should be a combine all-star and is draftable on measurables alone, but must sharpen his eyes and instincts to reach his potential.",5.80
"Physically impressive, moldable right guard prospect with a good soldier's attitude to go along with untapped physical ability, though his tape falls short of his intangibles at this stage of his development. Could be a pet project for an offensive line coach confident he can turn Fulton into an effective mauler.",5.80
"Strong, physical zone corner with the toughness, awareness and football IQ to function highly in short spaces. A solid tackler, Gaines plays bigger than his size and takes a professional approach. Can make an immediate impact on special teams and work his way into a lineup.",5.80
"Explosive, high-motor see-and-go reactor whose calling card is his ability to pressure the edge. Does not play to his weight-room numbers against the run and lacks desirable length and smarts, projecting as a situational 3-4 rush linebacker.",5.80
"Big, durable, blue-collar guard who is generally effective despite lacking exceptional physical traits. As a starter, is the type you look to replace, but could be serviceable backup in a slide-protection scheme given his size, intelligence and functional anchor.",5.80
"Adequate-sized, pesky corner lacking desirable length and physicality to survive outside. Has competitive makeup for the position to vie for a No. 4 or No. 5 corner spot.",5.80
"A big, thick-bodied, physical cover man who looks more destined for a future at safety than cornerback in the pros. Size and physicality will appeal to teams, though character concerns will cloud his draft status and could knock him off some draft boards. Will require close monitoring and has bust potential.",5.80
"Very good-sized mauler functions well in a phone booth. Possesses the strength and power to match up vs. big bodies. The farther he is asked to move, the more he will struggle and would be best in a man-blocking power scheme.",5.80
"Big-framed, smart, active, high-effort player who willingly does the dirty work and will make it difficult for coaches to cut him. Best chance to stick could be as a five-technique, but could also draw interest as a developmental left end. Has the makeup to surprise if he learns to play with power.",5.80
"Very diminutive, outside receiver with the timed speed to threaten the field vertically and potentially contribute in the return game. Needs to prove he can bow up against better competition and is more than a track athlete.",5.80
"Smooth, competitive, versatile receiver with an impressive skill set which translates well to the evolution of NFL offenses. Can work at flanker or slot and has potential to become a No. 2 or No. 3 receiver in a system incorporating spread concepts. Is the type of player you root for, having persevered through an adverse upbringing and lingering baggage, which forced him to mature the hard way. Would be best served landing in a close-knit locker room with a nurturing position coach.",5.80
"A functional positional blocker who lacks the foot quickness, athletic ability and strength desired in a starter, yet consistently finds a way to get the job done and overcome his physical limitations. Intelligence and intangibles are off the charts and could allow him to capture and hold onto a starting job. The sum is better than the parts.",5.80
"Looks the part, but strength, technical and instinctual deficiences are too significant to overlook. Did not distinguish himself enough as a senior to be considered more than a developmental prospect.",5.80
"Sawed-off, stout, physical, downhill thumper with eventual-starter potential inside a 3-4 front where he's protected and able to attack the ball. However, suspect character and work ethic make him a risky investment, and he'd be best served in a locker room with a strong veteran presence.",5.80
"Undersized, fluid, quick-twitch, college field corner who figures to raise eyebrows when the stopwatches come out before the draft. Will always have size and strength limitations, but has a chance to stick as a sub-package defender given his speed, feistiness and ball skills.",5.80
"A Division II standout with rare measurables and production, Janis must prove that he can translate his small-school success to the field against better competition.",5.80
"A receiver-turned-cornerback in a safety’s body, Jean-Baptiste looks the part and has intriguing ball skills, strength and upside, though he lacks elite athletic ability, is smoother than he is sudden and does not consistently play to his size. Workout numbers will dictate his ultimate role and draft value, but on tape shows skills to warrant developmental consideration from teams employing press or Cover 2.",5.80
"Strapping, athletic, long-armed, ascending talent who did not play a starring role in a run-and-gun, receiver-dominated spread offense, but has raw physical tools to develop into a balanced “Y” tight end. Should only get better and has potential to become an asset in the running game and a mismatch in the passing game.",5.80
"A strong, stocky, compactly built, leverage-power rusher who operates mostly out of a crouched, 2-point stance and brings a bulldog tenacity to the field. Would be most ideally suited for an aggressive, one-gapping 3-4 front such as the Colts, Ravens or Steelers in a similar mold as Cowboys 2008 sixth-round pick Erik Walden.",5.80
"Wiry, narrow-framed, high-cut, athletic defensive back who started the first five games of his senior season at left cornerback before manning free safety for the final seven contests. Would be best in a predominantly zone scheme where he would have value as a versatile backup.",5.80
"A Miami transfer, Johnson is a big, nifty-footed runner with enough run strength and burst to be productive in a downhill power scheme or as a one-cut zone runner. However, he will have to take better care of the football and make strides in pass protection to earn carries.",5.80
"Experienced, intelligent, competitive, athletic, strength-deficient zone blocker. Has everything you want intangibly and has developmental value, but has to make significant strength gains and perfect his technique to survive against longer, more powerful NFL defensive ends.",5.80
"Chiseled, height-weight-speed see-and-go reactor with intriguing athleticism, versatility and upside who shows in flashes, but leaves evaluators wanting more. Is likely to boost his stock during the pre-draft process, and could warrant consideration from 4-3 teams as a Sam or Will, or from 3-4 teams as a rush linebacker. Play will reach another level if/when his processor speed catches up to his physical talent.",5.80
"Lean, explosive, highly athletic rush linebacker prospect who overwhelmed inferior tackles at the Division II level and has clear developmental value and upside potential. Best deployed with pinned ears and see-ball, get-ball instructions, Jones is raw, but has enticing speed and crude pass-rush ability for a patient, positional coach to mold.",5.80
"A good college football player lacking ideal physical traits for the NFL game. Functioned well as a short-hole, nickel zone corner for a national championship team and was well-schemed to play the ball in front of him and turned loose to attack. Classic 'tweener who could compete in situational packages, but is vulnerable to be mismatched against. Will need to make his mark on special teams and in the return game to carve a role. Has a make-it attitude and winning mentality that could allow him to overcome his physical limitations. Compares favorably to Panthers 2009 seventh-rounder Captain Munnerlyn.",5.80
"Small-framed, athletic, finesse, run-around Will linebacker who will have to stand out on special teams to earn a reserve spot.",5.80
"Big, experienced, wall-off zone blocker with a ceiling as a serviceble starter, though questionable versatility detracts from his appeal in a league offering few center-only spots. Has to be a masterful technician given his short arms and pedestrian athleticism.",5.80
"A prep basketball standout, Latimer is a well-built, sure-handed, West Coast possession receiver whose hardwood background is evident in his leaping ability, body control and hand-eye coordination. Lacks ideal explosiveness, gear change and flexibility. Could be effective running slants and making contested catches to beat zone coverage and succeed in the red zone. Has a ceiling as a No. 3.",5.80
"Long-armed, soft-bodied college left tackle most ideally suited for a role as a versatile, swing backup in a zone-blocking scheme. Has not learned how to translate his athletic ability and explosion to the field, yet possesses enough length, agility and untapped talent to find a role for a patient offensive line coach. Could warrant interest inside as a guard or center where he has help on each side.",5.80
"Big, experienced, highly competitive, short-area base blocker at his best in a phone booth. Lacks ideal power and athleticism, but has football intelligence, leadership traits and a bulldog’s mentality. Should earn a spot as an interior backup initially, but brings grit to the line and has the makeup to outplay his draft position.",5.80
"Big, tough, physical, ornery blocker with starter-quality positional traits and intangible qualities. Is best in a phone booth, where he excels as a run and pass blocker, and is smart and savvy enough to contribute outside in emergency situations.",5.80
"A physically talented receiving tight end, Lyerla was overshadowed by the play of emerging freshman Johnny Mundt and litany of issues (suspensions, drugs, academics). Has overcome a lot of adversity stemming back to his youth and defied the odds to become an impactful performer. Talent grades could garner interest in the second round, but past history could easily knock him down several rounds and off many draft boards. Would benefit tremendously from a coach willing to serve as a strong father figure.",5.80
"A big, athletic prospect who displayed the most potential as a freshman at Notre Dame. Has underachieved since transferring closer to home and shedding considerable weight. Must prove motivated to reach his potential. Finished the season strong and finally showed signs of the talent he displayed as a standout freshman. Could benefit from a strong, mentoring, veteran position coach. Interview process will dictate draft status.",5.80
"Big, narrow-framed, long-levered defensive lineman who shows flashes of potential as a developmental, 4-3 left end, though he needs to fortify his base as a run defender and hone his technique as a pass rusher.",5.80
"Very driven, Ivy-League pocket passer with physical limitations that could relegate him to a backup role in the pros. Is the type who can be trusted to step in with limited practice reps and finish a game. Might have the most long-term potential as a coach, yet has the intangible qualities that could allow him to stick in the league for 10-plus years. Has traits to surprise as a spot-starter once he acclimates to the pro game.",5.80
"English-born, high-motor, developmental five-technique with intriguing growth potential. Is a bit top-heavy. Still growing into his body and learning how to use his hands. Has generated solid production from a wave role and could continue to be molded into a solid fencepost for a 3-4 front. Draws semblances to a young Brett Keisel, drafted in the seventh round by the Steelers in 2002, and has the makeup to play a long time in an unsung role occupying blockers and defending the run.",5.80
"Jack of all trades, master of none. Adjusted from a triple-option quarterbacking role as a junior to a tailback role as a senior and has enough athletic ability to warrant a chance as a change-of-pace back in the pros. Could even be tried as a return man and cornerback, where he began his college career. Would benefit from focusing on one position and will require some time to develop. Practice-squad candidate.",5.80
"Pure dropback, strong-armed thrower who will require patient, confidence-building play-calling and a clean pocket to function at a high level in the NFL. Has starter talent in a vertical, downfield passing attack if he can learn to take command of a huddle and continue progressing as a decision-maker. How he interviews with teams could go a long way toward determining his draft status.",5.80
"Wiry, smoother-than-sudden, off-man/cover-3 corner who upped his visibility as a junior by showing improved playmaking ability, which prompted a premature leap to the NFL. Could compete for a job as a No. 4, but lack of ideal explosiveness, top-end speed and bump-and-run ability limits his ceiling.",5.80
"Raw, physically gifted, Division II standout with untapped potential given his combination of size, length and movement skills. Will have defensive line coaches drooling in workouts, and has the dimensions and athleticism to warrant consideration as a draftable, developmental investment with positional versatility to play defensive end or three-technique in an even front or five-technique in an odd front.",5.80
"Will tease evaluators with his arm and athletic talent, but has yet to prove he can throw with the precision needed to sustain a starting job in the pros. Has clear starting-caliber traits, but is still learning what it takes to direct an offense and make good decisions and is still very much a work in progress. Has talent worth molding in a backup role and will pique the interest of QB coaches who work him out in the spring and view his raw tools. Will require a strong offensive line and a full supporting cast of weapons to function in a starting role.",5.80
"Big, long-armed leaner with sheer size and length and enough movement skill to function at an adequate level on the right side, though his high-maintenance conditioning, intermittent intensity and uneven performance turns off some teams.",5.80
"Diminutive, game-managing pocket passer still recovering from a torn ACL. Would benefit from a moving pocket that can create open throwing lanes, yet does not have the foot quickness desired for a rollout passing game. Possesses a skill set most ideally suited for a backup or No. 3 role. Intelligence, intangibles and experience are all pluses.",5.80
"Thickly built, relatively nondescript contributor who decided to forgo his senior season despite never establishing himself as a force. Has size and strength to warrant developmental consideration as a five-technique, but lacks exceptional traits and will have to commit to handling the dirty work to have longevity.",5.80
"A quick, athletic penetrator best working in a single-gap, heavy-movement, stunting front. Flashes the ability to disrupt and could be effective working in a rotational role.",5.80
"Tiny, athletic playmaker with the toughness, burst and acceleration to factor readily in the return game and offer a flair as a receiver. Good hands and ability to create some magic with the ball overcompensate for marginal size. Can be effective on bubble screens, reverses and quick tosses.",5.80
"A valuable part of the Wisconsin offense, Pedersen is not equipped to line up as an in-line tight end, but could function as a complementary H-back capable of deploying in multiple spots and catching short-to-intermediate passes in the playaction game.",5.80
An old-school fullback with explosive power to pave the way as an iso-lead blocker and enough speed and athletic ability to carve a niche as a core special-teams performer. Valuable pass protector with good hands and short-yardage running power to contribute when needed.,5.80
"Lean, fluid, fast, finesse cover man whose raw physical ability and testing numbers belie frustratingly uneven performance. Has starter-caliber athleticism and will buoy his stock when the stopwatches come out, but poor instincts, tackling and tape are reasons for pause.",5.80
"A quick, agile, tilted nose who is effective slanting and stunting and working his way into the backfield. Has kicked outside in passing situations and has the tools to pique the interest of aggressive, one-gapping, 3-4 fronts such as the Jets, Steelers or Ravens as a five-technique. Developmental talent with raw traits to mold.",5.80
"A compactly built, light-footed pivot with that elevated his draft standing after clocking sub-5.0-flat 40 times at his pro day workout. Has the size, power and agility to eventually compete for a starting job.",5.80
NA,NA
"Very lean, narrow-framed, finesse ""X"" receiver who made an immediate impact at Colorado before knee injuries derailed his progress. Measurables will go a long way in determining his ultimate draft value, and his success at the next level is dependent upon his ability to make plays in the vertical passing game. Has a boom-or-bust element. Size and durability are question marks.",5.80
"Adequate-sized, smart, experienced, competitive center who commanded the offensive line, made all the calls and was a team leader for the Rams. At worst, should stick as a backup, but has developmental value and starter potential in a zone scheme. Could help himself by proving versatile enough to back up at guard.",5.80
"Rodgers’ career arc was affected by Cal’s coaching turnover, as the former high school receiver was recruited as a tight end by Jeff Tedord’s staff and bulked up to 275 pounds as a sophomore when he was out of shape, in part because of a torn labrum and torn foot ligament. As a junior, Rodgers shed 30 pounds and shifted to inside receiver for Sonny Dykes, enabling him to show his more natural “F” tight end skills. Is an unpolished product, but could be a better pro than college player.",5.80
"A productive, 4-3 weakside rusher who came on as a senior and it made his last season his best. Could fit most ideally as a 3-4 outside linebacker in a zone-blitzing scheme like the Steelers or Ravens. Compares favorably to Chargers 2009 first-round pick Larry English, an overhyped, overdrafted, marginal producer in the pros.",5.80
"The Pac-12’s leading rusher, Sankey has an overall average skill set and generally gains what is blocked for him. Is instinctive, competitive and shifty enough to be effective as a complementary zone runner, but must improve in pass protection.",5.80
"A Fresno State transfer, Saunders is a lightweight, quicker-than-fast, competitive slot receiver and punt returner. Will always have size limitations, but has the hands, suddenness, polish and moxie to be a useful piece for a creative offensive coordinator able to free him up. Return ability adds to value.",5.80
"Developmental right tackle with experience playing on the inside and offers versatility as a utility swing backup. Possesses eventual-starter potential, but could always be restricted by athletic limitations and leave teams desiring better.",5.80
"Good-sized, productive, zone runner with enough physical traits to warrant consideration as a complementary back. Benefited from an offense featuring a lot of fly sweeps and lateral runs that have not translated well to the NFL game. Overall character will require closer evaluation and can determime draft status.",5.80
"Thickly built, high-motor, highly competitive edge defender who projects best as a left outside linebacker in a 3-4 scheme. Lacks desirable dimensions, flexibility and finishing speed, but has more than enough play strength, tenacity and toughness to compensate.",5.80
"A weakside pass rusher who could most ideally project to the rush linebacker position in the pros for a 3-4 front, Smith graded more highly as a junior than he did as a senior, yet possesses the tools to earn a starting job in the pros in multiple schemes. Versatility is a plus.",5.80
"A fast-flowing, instinctive, run-and-hit weakside linebacker capable of producing at a high level if he can bulk up and withstand the rigors of the NFL.",5.80
"Southward, who played only one year of high school football, is a size-speed prospect still learning positional nuances. Could get his foot in the door on special teams and buy some time to develop as a reserve.",5.80
"Scrappy, competitive, try-hard, tough guy who does not always look pretty, but consistently finds a way to get the job done. An efficient zone blocker, Steen understands angles and leverage. He could be ideally suited for a zone-based ground game such as the Eagles, Seahawks or Packers.",5.80
"Pitt’s all-time leading pass catcher, Street is a narrowly built, long-levered, smooth-muscled receiver whose best assets are his length and hands. Needs to incorporate more physicality into his overall game, but has the ability to be an effective zone beater and red-zone target.",5.80
"Big-framed, raw, aggressive FCS standout who flashes a nice combination of foot quickness, punch strength and nastiness to warrant consideration as a project. Has a bit of a bull-in-a-china-shop element at this stage of his career, but has moldable tools and could develop into a swing backup.",5.80
"An overaged, competitive, physical linebacker of Tongan descent, Unga went from walk-on to captain at BYU, where he was a tackling machine in his lone season as a starter. Skill set and college responsibilities translate well to the pro game, and he’s capable of serving as a core special-teams player and solid backup for a 3-4 team.",5.80
"Tall, angular, late-blooming five-technique prospect with the body type sought by teams employing odd fronts. Should only get bigger, stronger and more polished. If so, has potential to grow into an impact lineman. Broken foot bone suffered in freak accident prior to Senior Bowl could hinder his draft status.",5.80
"A speed merchant with raw catching skills, Washington is still developing as a football player and has the type of determination to become a success story if he continues to refine his hands and work at the craft.",5.80
"A fluid, loose-hipped, versatile cover man who projects to a No. 3 or No. 4 corner in the pros, Watkins could most ideally fit in the slot, with enough physicality to defend the run and fine short-area cover skills to match up with shifty receivers.",5.80
"A gifted athlete with NFL pedigree and intriguing developmental tools as a speed rusher, Webster could prove to be better fit as a flex tight end in the pros, possessing more of an offensive temperament and the size, wingspan, athletic ability and coordination to create mismatches in a similar mold as Broncos TE Julius Thomas and Browns TE Jordan Cameron exiting college with limited football experience.",5.80
"Talented, enigmatic Division II edge rusher who marches to the beat of his own drum, but has intriguing, raw, natural ability to harass quarterbacks. Wild-card prospect with diamond-in-the-rough characteristics if a defensive line coach is able to refine the technical aspects of his game and stoke his fire.",5.80
"A good-sized, shuffle-and-bail corner who dropped considerable weight to move from free safety. Has athletic tools that could warrant refining for a patient position coach.",5.80
"Physically gifted, energetic, pedigreed runner with potential to develop into a productive sledgehammer and be a better pro than college player if he embraces a violent running style, remains healthy and keeps his head screwed on straight.",5.80
"High-energy overachiever with a special-teams temperament. Stands out most for his competitiveness, effort, versatility and swagger. Brings the feisty type of attitude desired on a Jeff Fisher or Jim Schwartz defense. Will factor immediately on special teams and could work his way into a starting lineup.",5.80

"Compact, thickly built, mid-major workhorse with a blend of one-cut and downhill elements. Generally gains what is blocked for him and has a ceiling as a No. 2/tandem back in a man- or zone-blocking scheme.

Is worth trying as a zone corner, could add depth to a secondary and compete on special teams.",5.60

"Burst onto the scene as a junior-college transfer in 2012 when he led the nation in completion percentage (72.5), executing a quarterback-friendly system and putting himself on the NFL radar.

"Productive, monotone, unrefined, enigmatic mid-major receiver with one of the best pair of hands in the draft, though he comes with concerning tweener traits he will have to overcome.

Has size, athleticism and hands to warrant developmental consideration if he tests well.",5.60

"Three-by-two, soccer-style kicker with enough leg strength to warrant a chance in a camp, though he must prove he can more consistently handle kicking accurately from greater depths to earn a job.",5.50
A massive run-stuffing space-occupier with the bulk to plug the middle or function outside in a traditional 3-4 front. His calling card will be defending the run on early downs.,5.50
"Raw, lean man cover corner with the quickness and explosive burst to warrant a look as a No. 4 or No. 5 cornerback. Was regularly assigned to the opponent's top receiver and did not have as many opportunities the last two seasons, when his interception production diminished.",5.50

"A sixth-year senior, Ramsey has the physical tools to serve in a rotational role as an aggressive five-technique or 4-3 left end, though his injury history and long-term durability concerns limit his value and could scare teams off.",5.50
"A one-cut, inside zone runner, Redd is a solid, all-around performer with a No. 2 skill set. Can pick up yardage in chunks and would most ideally be suited for a ground game such as the Seahawks, Eagles or Packers.",5.50
"Lacks prototype measurements and arm talent and played in a high-percentage, dink-and-dunk passing game that has not translated well to the pros, yet possesses the intangibles, toughness, football intelligence and escapability to warrant developing. Is the type of player you root for and has make-it qualities that could eventually surprise. Potentially adds situational value.",5.50
"Good-sized, downhill, monotone runner who left school with a year of eligibility remaining despite lacking exceptional athletic traits. Will have to earn his keep as an inside runner, though he faces an uphill battle to earn a spot as a reserve.",5.50

"Heavy-bodied, dink-and-dunk, rhythm passer who could be challenged to fit the ball into tight NFL windows. Has the makeup desired in a No. 3 QB and could develop into a functional backup in a West Coast passing game.",5.50
"Similar to former Longhorns DT Henry Melton, Whaley is a converted running back who outgrew the position and flipped to the other side of the ball. Whaley is still very raw and inexperienced and will require patience to develop. Is coming off season-ending knee surgery and could take additional time to be ready. Developmental project with intriguing upside.",5.50

Split time in a three-man backfield until being dismissed from the team for his multiple violations of team rules. Must prove he can stay disciplined and learn what it means to be a pro to make it.

NA,NA
"A high school safety, Boyd had a breakout senior season, but his stats are more intriguing than his tape, which reveals an unpolished, albeit athletic, linebacker who needs to play with better strength, discipline and urgency to last. Best chance will be on the weak side in a fast-flowing 4-3 that keeps him clean and free to chase.",5.40

"Straight-line mauler who functions in the run game when a defender is lined over the top of him, but will struggle vs. any quick movement and needs to be in a phone booth to survive. Has been a mainstay at right guard and could increase his value as a swing interior backup if he proves he can handle the pivot.",5.40

"A Florida transfer, Patchan’s lone season at BC was the first of his career in which he was a healthy, full-time starter. He’s a tall, stiff, linear, zone blocker whose relatively short wingspan dictates a shift to guard, though he isn’t ideally suited for the interior given his core strength deficiency and wobbly base. Practice-squad candidate who must dedicate himself to the weight room and the practice field and tap into the raw ability that made him a highly sought after recruit in order to have longevity.",5.40

"Enormously powerful defensive lineman. Has the look and feel of the biggest, strongest kid on the playground but hasn't figured out how to unlock his natural gifts and consistently dominate the rest of the kids on the playground just yet. Williams can play in an odd or even front, and is able to hold the point as a two-gapper or disrupt upfield. With coaching and more experience, Williams should be able to match the athleticism with the power and become a consistent Pro Bowler with a ceiling that goes even higher than that.",7.40
"Won't dazzle with blazing speed or outrageous size, but is good in both categories. Complete receiver with game-changing ability to win downfield. Has the skill and twitch to be a consistent, high-volume target in the short and intermediate games with the ability to produce against any coverage. Cooper won't be able to run roughshod over NFL safeties like he did in college, but he should be able to help a passing game improve quickly.",7.10
"It's hard to find many weaknesses for Ray. He pursues the quarterback and the ball like it's his last snap.

He also has the athleticism and strength to play in any defensive front.",7.00
"Winston is a big, highly competitive pocket passer who played in a pro-style offense and showed an ability to anticipate throwing windows, scan the entire field and make the NFL throws. His wind-up delivery and marginal mobility outside the pocket are reminiscent of Byron Leftwich, but his arm talent and issues with decision making are more in line with Eli Manning's. Winston's football potential is clearer than so-called ""system"" or ""one-read"" quarterbacks, but every stone must be overturned in an attempt to piece together a predictive character profile on Winston. Winston's supreme confidence might be considered arrogance by some, but even that trait will be alluring to teams who need to find a franchise quarterback.",7.00
Projection-based prospect with elite size and the traits to become a dominant run-stuffing defensive end in an odd front. Armstead has the explosiveness off the snap and in his jarring punch to gain early advantages and control offensive linemen. Armstead is a fast riser but is still very raw. He will need patience and coaching and must become a more effective pass rusher at some point.,6.80
"Collins is a tempo-setter who can energize a defense with his downhill, aggressive style. He is at his best when he can attack rather than sit back in coverage and process. Collins' tackling, pursuit angles and speed to the sideline can help a defense shut down rushing attacks, but his inconsistencies in coverage will be tested by NFL offenses.",6.80
"Strong-side 3-4 outside linebacker with the physical traits and above-average potential to set the edge or spill runs wide to an early demise. Fowler is a competitive pass rusher getting by on athleticism and inside moves right now, but has a Pro Bowl ceiling with double-digit sack potential if he takes coaching and addresses his rush technique.",6.80
"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver.",6.80
"A 3-4 outside linebacker with the length, toughness and closing burst to immediately help a run defense. Gregory could stand to add more weight to his frame and needs plenty of technique work and a patient coach for his pass-rush skill to match his traits. High-ceiling, low-floor prospect.",6.80
"The rehab work and NFL Scouting Combine medicals will be extremely important for Gurley's draft stock as teams assess his potential durability as an NFL running back. He played less than 40 percent of his team's offensive snaps over the last three years, so there is plenty of tread still on the tires. Has the talent to be a top-five NFL running back, but ACL tear clouds the short-term picture.",6.80
"Scheme-based quarterback who will face the same challenges that several quarterbacks before him have faced in terms of learning how to read defenses and go through progressions. The tape was less kind to Mariota than expected, but his size, athleticism and consistency of football character throughout his career are necessary traits in becoming a good-to-great quarterback. Mariota's ability to create outside the pocket will help win games here and there and buy him time as he plies his craft. However, to reach his potential and match the play with the traits, he must develop more poise and feel in the pocket and improve his field vision. Mariota is no lock to be a great NFL quarterback, but his floor is much higher than any of the quarterbacks drafted in 2014.",6.80
"Like former Hawkeye Riley Reiff, Scherff has measurables and traits to play tackle in the league but might be better suited to play guard. More powerful than explosive, Reiff is not a scheme-specific talent and can maul or move in run game. Road-grader with pancake-man potential, but has holes in his pass protection that will be exposed on the next level -- especially at tackle.",6.80
"With his thick frame and powerful upper body, Shelton has moments where he can dominate at the point of attack. He was forced to chase sideline to sideline due to the nature of Pac-12 offenses, but when he faced downhill competition like Stanford, he stepped up. Shelton is an above average interior pass rusher for a man his size thanks to his surprising athleticism. He is a fit in a two-gap scheme and could benefit from playing fewer snaps than he was forced to play at Washington.",6.80
"Projects as 3-4 outside linebacker. Considered one of the best pure edge rushers in the draft, but needs more sophistication to his approach. Has speed and explosion to become an absolute menace for a creative defensive coordinator. High-impact talent but needs to crank up competitive nature in order to reach his potential.",6.70
"Penetrating big man who took a huge step forward as an NFL prospect in 2014. Brown has hand quickness and uses hands like an NFL starter. His instincts and feel off the snap help him to get into the backfield quickly. Some personnel men believe Brown can play multiple spots along the line in a 4-3 or 3-4 defense, which could put him in play for a high number of teams.",6.70
"Consistent four-year starter for the Gamecocks. He has technique issues that need to be coached up in pass protection, but he also has the talent to improve in that area. Powerful drive-blocker who uses leverage to fire out and generate instant movement in tight spaces. He is best-suited to a power scheme. Cann has the plug-and-play traits that could make him an instant starter.",6.70
NA,NA
"Like Duane Brown, Clemmings played high school basketball and was a late switch to the offensive-tackle position in college. There are holes in his protection technique that are no sure-thing to be fixed, but they are coachable. Clemmings will continue to learn the position and improve. He has the physical traits to become a Pro Bowl left tackle if he can handle the move to that side.",6.70
"His violent running style is a joy to watch, but might have to be tempered to extend his career. He is a ""race car in the red"" on just about every snap and refuses to give in, which leads to many big runs. Zone, gap, power ... it doesn't really matter because Coleman can fit all schemes. Has the burst and top-end speed to be a game-changing running back for a team looking for a workhorse.",6.70
Lumbering brawler who has had a level of success in hyper-competitive SEC West. Lacks athleticism to be a consistent left tackle and will have to move to right tackle or bump inside to guard. Collins plays with a mean streak that is evident in every game and could come in and start right away in a power running game as a guard.,6.70
"Immensely talented cornerback who brings the entire triangle (height, weight, speed) with him. Still learning technique and how to sink his feet with his eyes, but the instincts and athleticism to make plays on the ball both short and deep are what set him apart. Collins is a work in progress, but his physical and play traits create a very high ceiling if he continues to learn to play the position.",6.70
Outrageously productive linebacker with a nose for the ball. Dawson averages a tackle every 5.3 snaps and either caused or recovered a total of 8 turnovers during the 2014 season. Evaluators understand that Dawson has been a handful while at TCU and that will turn some teams off to him completely. Dawson can play inside in a 2-gap scheme but is a natural fit at 4-3 WILL.,6.70
"His power at the point of attack and ability to discard blockers and actually make plays rather than just eating space will have 3-4 teams very excited about their potential nose guard of the future. However, his lack of pass-rushing prowess could limit just how high he rises on draft boards.",6.70
"Productive, steady performer in the middle with above-average size and length for the position but below-average agility. McKinney plays within the scheme and finds himself near the play frequently. He plays with strength and has an ability to take on offensive linemen and get downhill to finish his tackles. McKinney looks like an above-average NFL inside linebacker who could become part of a really good defense. He lacks star-making talent, though.",6.70
"Parker won't win the NFL Scouting Combine, but he will win when the ball is in the air. With his height and an exceptional wingspan (80 inches), he consistently catches everything in his vicinity. Parker isn't going to overpower cornerbacks and he will have more contested catches than most explosive wideouts. Parker has consistently posted eye-popping yards-per-catch numbers during his time at Louisville. Parker needs time to get into his routes and his talents would be on full display in a West Coast passing attack.",6.70
"Big and powerful with a right tackle's play strength and demeanor, but enough foot quickness to protect on the left side. Peat has the physical tools to be an upper-echelon run blocker with pass-protection ability, but he needs to improve his technique in order to protect with consistency. Peat has been well-coached and is one of the most game-ready offensive linemen in this year's draft.",6.70
"Nose tackle with desired height, weight and speed. Flashes talent necessary to project a ceiling as a dominant run stuffer best suited for a 3-4 defense. Phillips' ability to eat up blocks should help him earn a high grade, but it's his potential as a big athlete with above-average range for the position that could turn him into a Pro Bowl nose.",6.70
"Long, twitchy 4-3 outside linebacker with outstanding range to become a highly restrictive defender able to make plays well outside of his area against both the run and pass. With his big-play potential, Thompson could become a unique chess piece in the hands of the right defensive coordinator. He can help on special teams right away and might start off as a sub-package player while he fills out his frame.",6.70
"He's a bump-and-run cornerback with the length, deep speed and confidence to handle himself down the field against speed. Waynes plays too handsy for NFL officials and that could show up on Sundays due to his lack of great feet and suddenness. He needs technique work and could be inconsistent early on, but he has a very high floor.",6.70
"He's not just a product of West Virginia's system -- he's talented. White competes hard for the ball and has the leaping, hands and high-pointing ability to be a factor down the field despite his lack of top-end speed. His improvement from 2013 to 2014 is a great sign, but his 40 time could define his draft stock.",6.70
"Cover cornerback with the talent to play on an island, and the swagger to regroup and forget when beaten. Williams can cover outside or from the slot, and has potential to come in and start right away for an aggressive man-cover defense. With consistency of effort, Williams could become the best cornerback to come out of this draft.",6.70
"Despite having first-round talent, Abdullah's lack of preferred NFL size and issues with ball security might cause some teams to shy away from him in the opening round. Abdullah has explosive potential as a runner and ball-catcher and is a natural zone-scheme fit. His high character will make him a hit during interview process.",6.40
"While the comparison to Marshawn Lynch might be a little much considering Lynch's exploits in the NFL, Ajayi's running style and body type are very similar to Lynch's and Ajayi features an improving stiff arm and physicality that has become Lynch's calling card. Ajayi has the ability to play all three downs while mashing in short yardage and near the goal line. Scouts have been quietly circling Ajayi as a second-tier running back who offers tremendous value on the second day (Rounds 2-3) of the draft.",6.40
"Bennett is a disciplined, intelligent player who is a fit for teams looking for an upfield disruptor. He relies on his initial burst, hand usage and technique to win at the point of attack. Bennett has the potential to dominate sluggish or weak guards, but might have issues with true power guards in the NFL.",6.40
"Dupree is an explosive, powerful athlete with a background in basketball. While he's been productive at Kentucky, his tape doesn't always do his potential justice. He must continue to improve as a pass rusher, but his traits are undeniable. Difference between being good and great might be his coordinator.",6.40
"While they have different body types, Flowers will have some of the same strengths and flaws 2014 first-round pick Greg Robinson had coming in. Flowers has the size, feet and talent to be a very good left tackle but he will be a work in progress unless he can eliminate some of the balance issues that could plague him.",6.40
"NFL evaluators are very worried about Ogbuehi's core strength and ability to anchor in pass protection, but some of his anchor issues could be improved with technique work -- especially where his hands are concerned. He should be a plus run blocker, especially on stretch plays, but needs to add strength and work on technique if he is to reach his play potential. Based on his traits and his position, he will likely get drafted on projection over production.",6.40
"Davis has the height, weight and length of a first-rounder, but his draft value will be hindered by his lack of productivity as a pass rusher. If Davis can get his overall production to match his talent and traits, he'll have a long NFL career.",6.30
"Explosive, leggy outside linebacker who has surprising strength at the point of attack, and the hands and length to become an outstanding edge-setter. Harold's burst upfield to threaten the edge is pro caliber and his ability to bend the corner at a 45-degree angle creates potential for him to become a quality pass rusher from either outside linebacker spot in a 3-4.",6.30
"An elite-level tackle when he exited the high school ranks, Humphries relies on his superior athleticism and fist-fight mentality rather than an improved skill set and steady technique. He might always have an issue with being a leaner, but his hand placement should improve with more work and coaching. When he improves in that area, he could become a solid NFL starter on the left side.",6.30
"One of the most explosive runners in college football during his time at Miami, Johnson doesn't need much of a crease to make defenses pay. His explosive quickness and elusiveness should help him adapt quickly to NFL speed and his feel and courage as a one-cut runner should earn him instant playing time. Johnson's lack of protection skills and his injury concerns could force him into a committee situation.",6.30
"Johnson is a three-year starting cornerback who showed great improvement in man coverage from 2013
to 2014. While he lacks desired weight at the position, his cover skills, athleticism and competitiveness give him a shot to come in and start right away. Johnson can play gunner on special teams.",6.30
"Kikaha is the most accomplished pure pass rusher in this draft class. Relies on a relentless motor off the edge more than athleticism. He has an elite determination to get to the quarterback. While he seems to specialize in just rushing the passer, Kikaha has the power, hands and frame to improve against the run. It might take some work to get fully comfortable as a stand-up 3-4 OLB, but Kikaha is a very safe draft prospect as long as his medicals check out.",6.30
"Teams will either be wary of Orchard's single season of sack dominance or they will view it as an indicator of growth and potential stardom. Orchard will be below average against the run, but his draft grade and paycheck will be tied to his athleticism and pass-rush talent. If he can develop counter moves, he has big potential. If not, he might be nothing more than a middling, situational pass rusher.",6.30
"Rare combination of size, top-end speed and suddenness that can be found in some of the best receivers in the game. His routes are sloppy and a work in progress, but his hands keep him out of the top tier of receivers. His drops will drive teams crazy, but his physical traits and ability to hit the big play should warrant early round consideration.",6.30
"Rare start-stop-start suddeness. His ability to change gears instantly gives him a chance to develop into a talented cover cornerback. With more work on technique and overall discipline, Rollins has the physical tools to become a very good NFL starter.",6.30
"Individual elements of Strong's game aren't awe-inspiring, but scouts really love the entirety of his game and where it is headed. His strength, size and ability to catch contested throws will be coveted by some, but his issues with separation quickness can only be solved if he becomes much better in his route-running. Strong looks the part of a physical, possession receiver with a relatively high floor.",6.30
"Cover corner with average size and outstanding speed. Has shown the instincts to play off coverage and the athleticism to play press. It is a bit of a concern that scouts and even opposing coaches have commented on Darby's toughness, but he doesn't have very many missed or broken tackles on his docket and his cover skills should be prioritized over his run support regardless. He clearly has starter's ability at the position.",6.20
"Dorsett is an ascending prospect who has averaged more than 25 yards per catch since 2012. He can challenge teams vertically inside or outside and he has home-run potential after the catch as a slot receiver. With smaller wide receivers like T.Y. Hilton and Antonio Brown proving that small and fast can win in the NFL, Dorsett should be coveted by more than one team and has the potential to turn into a star in the NFL.",6.20
"Doss is a thin but functionally strong cornerback with an overriding desire to compete for every ball thrown his way, which led to 33 passes defensed and 15 interceptions during his three-year stint at Tulane. He wasn't challenged very often in 2014 and his long speed will be revealed in his workouts, but his ball skills and ability to flip the field should gain him additional attention from general managers.",6.20
"Former defensive lineman who is still learning the nuances of offensive-line play after just two seasons as a starter. Has the length and foot quickness to play tackle, but film work shows that he will have a much more successful career at center. Possesses skill set and temperament to show rapid development, but might need a year or two of seasoning.",6.20
"If you are a zone-based team looking for an athletic, well-schooled tackle who can come in and compete for a starting position right away, then Fisher is your guy. He has the feet to play the left side and is savvy enough in the run game to man the right side. He needs more weight on his frame, but guard is also an option for Fisher.",6.20
NA,NA
"Golson has the twitch, ball skills and instincts to be an outstanding cornerback in the NFL. Despite playing so much zone in college, there is no reason to believe he can't transition to any coverage asked of him. He's well put-together, but his lack of height could force some teams to view him as a slot-only corner. Golson has Pro Bowl potential.",6.20
"While Grasu isn't a powerful center, he does display enough functional strength and movement skills to be able to assimilate into any offensive philosophy. Grasu can play bigger than his listed size and while he doesn't possess any overwhelming qualities or traits, there aren't any glaring holes in his game that should derail him. His leadership and winning pedigree should be a plus with GMs.",6.20
"Long-strider with vertical ability to change a game and the catch radius and body control to make the difficult look easy. However, Green-Beckham struggles against physical cornerbacks, and is raw as a route runner with poor instincts when it comes to getting open. It's easy to bet on the traits when a receiver has high football character and is a willing worker, but teams could pass on the traits early in the draft due to his perceived lack of work ethic and overall character.",6.20
"Very productive in big games and at big times. Greene has the athleticism and quicks to get open and has a natural smoothness in his routes. He might get pigeon-holed into a slot position, but that might not be a bad thing. Greene needs more route polish but should be able to compete for snaps right away.",6.20
"Dancing bear who possesses the talent, technique and physical traits to be a high-end NFL starter. Not asked to fire out on defenders often in Texas A&M scheme, so that might be an area where he has room for growth. Teams might have to decide between the film and the football character when slotting him.",6.20
"Three-year starter who doesn't look the part in his uniform, but teams should worry more about how the dish tastes rather than how it is plated. With surprising feet to pair with good length and balance, Havenstein has the tools to be a starting right tackle in the league. He will be adequate when asked to zone block, but he can fire out and use his hips to leverage defenders out of run lanes.",6.20
NA,NA
"Hunter isn't as heavy as Jason Pierre-Paul, but he has similar length, explosiveness and potential. The concern with Hunter is that his pass-rush instincts are marginal and he hasn't learned to use his physical advantages to rush the quarterback more consistently. Hunter's floor is high thanks to his overwhelming physical traits and motor, but his ceiling will only go as high as the level of coaching he is able to incorporate.",6.20
"Three-year starter on a line full of wide-bodies, Jackson entered the 2014 season as one of the top-rated guard prospects, but failed to distinguish himself. Has the talent to be a dependable, quality NFL starter, but he needs to work on weight and conditioning in order to improve his feet and reach his potential.",6.20
"Jarrett is built like a refrigerator, but he's hardly a stationary player. He lacks the overall size to be considered as a nose by most base 3-4 teams, but he's a perfect shade-nose fit for teams looking for a disruptor in a one-gap, penetrating front.",6.20
"Kendricks is an intelligent leader with high football character. Scouts don't see the same explosiveness in Eric as they see in his brother Mychal (Eagles LB), but they do see the same level of production and desire. Eric Kendricks plays with plus instincts against the run and pass. He has the athleticism and demeanor to be an impactful, productive outside linebacker in a 4-3 for years to come.",6.20
"Known for strong mental makeup, Mauldin is expected to check all of the character boxes, according to scouts. Productive pass rusher with a knack for beating tackles inside. Finds the ball quickly and chases against the run. Very active, productive collegiate player.",6.20
"Evaluators seem sure that Mayle is a moldable piece of clay who can become substantially better as a pro with more coaching and experience. Mayle clearly needs work with some of the basic fundamentals for the position, but with his size and an ability to win vertically, he has a high ceiling. He might need a redshirt year before he is ready to contribute consistently.",6.20
"Odighizuwa has some scheme versatility, but he's not necessarily a versatile player. Some scouts believe that he could open some eyes with his straight-line speed in his workout, but his marginal pass-rush skills and average athleticism could stunt his draft stock.",6.20
Early down linebacker who can make plays against the run but will struggle if isolated in coverage.  Perryman is a lunch-pail worker who enjoys the physical part of the game. Can be a highly productive NFL player but ceiling looks to be limited.,6.20
"Talented cover cornerback with size, ball skills and the confidence NFL teams are looking for, but lacks the necessary discipline and maturity on the field and in practice. Peters has raw talent, but is far from a polished cornerback, and that is without taking the character concerns into consideration.",6.20
"Richardson's tape is full of plays and near plays thanks to his outstanding pursuit and his ability to shed and find the ball quickly. While he lacks the desired height to play defensive end in an odd front, his length and outstanding work with his hands give him a shot at that spot. He has enough strength and room for more bulk to project inside in an upfield 4-3 defense. Richardson's athleticism and hand usage make him an ascending prospect with starter potential.",6.20
"Lacks ideal size for the position, but checks off just about every other box teams will be looking for. Smith's ability to match up in space against slot receivers and his willingness to get downhill and tackle will be coveted. Smith must learn to play under control as a tackler, but he should have a shot to come in and compete for a starting-safety or slot-corner job quickly.",6.20
"Smith isn't just combine-fast, he's game-fast and he would have had more than 12 touchdown catches during the 2014 season if he didn't have to slow down and wait on throws so often. Smith has the feet and hips to become much more than a deep-ball specialist and should be able to step right into a gunner spot on special teams. He still needs to learn his craft and improve his hands, but he has rare speed to score from anywhere on the field.",6.20
"A combo tight end who can help a team in the running game and through the air, Walford can be moved around the field. He lacks the elite athletic traits to be a game-changer at the position, but he is becoming a premium blocker. With teams looking for versatile TEs to create matchups in two-TE sets, Walford's stock should be high.",6.20
"Pass-catching, move tight end with straight-line play speed and an ability to stretch defenses deep. Williams comes from NFL bloodlines and has the self confidence often found in a former player's son, but he needs to improve his route running in order to become a more complete receiving threat. Williams led all college tight ends with 9 explosive catches (25-plus yards) in 2014 and should be an early target for teams looking for pass-catching weapons.",6.20
"Teams have an issue with his lack of production in 2014, but his initial burst off the snap can't be dismissed. Wright has been in a defensive-line rotation at Auburn over the last two seasons, but has never really shown an ability to be a run-stuffer. Wright is a fit in a penetrating scheme, but he must continue to improve as a pass rusher.",6.20
"Instinctive, athletic running back who has the foot quickness to create for himself when lanes constrict or blocks are missed. Yeldon lacks the ball security, top-end speed and desired tackle breaking to be a full-time starter. He's a versatile, rotational back with the ability to step in and step up.",6.20
"Intelligent, instinctive receiver with an advanced feel for getting himself open against zone coverage and off man. He's lacking a speed component to force cornerbacks to respect him over the top and he might not be physical enough to play outside. Agholor's best position could be working from the slot as a reliable possession receiver who can step right into the punt-returner job on Day 1.",6.10
"Data driven teams will be intrigued by Anderson's stuffs, impact tackles and total pressures, but the tape doesn't validate his potential to produce these numbers on the pro level. The body type screams 3-4 defensive end if he can bulk up and add power, but he might lack the balance and toughness to make it there. Anderson might just be a ""tweener"" without a clear NFL position fit.",6.10
NA,NA
"Physical cornerback who's at his best when he's able to see the play develop in front of him rather than having to lock down a target as a man-to-man cover corner. Carter's ability to tackle and play the ball in space should interest zone defenses, but a transition to safety might make sense if he can carry a bit more weight.",6.10
"Big, fast and raw. Vertical wide receiver with the ability to hit big plays and have dominant games. Coates must be coached to trust his quarterback and run through his deep routes in order to reach his potential. He has early round traits and late-round receiving skills right now, but the upside will be hard to pass on and could pay off in a big way. He will be tethered to the JUGS machine in rookie camp.",6.10
"Doesn't possess the strength or long speed to make a living as an outside receiver, but he can be an extremely effective weapon from the slot as a pro, turning short third-down throws into first downs. Diggs can make things happen when he has the ball in his hands and could become a consistent, productive weapon for the right offensive coordinator.",6.10
"He's a 3-4 defensive end or a 4-3 defensive tackle who has to make a living playing the run. Edwards failed to reach expectations while at Florida State and ended his career as a core defender rather than dominant force. His ""level of ability"" is higher than his current level of play and could continue to be the case unless he finds more passion and effort from snap to snap.",6.10
"Ekpre-Olomu's height and knee issue are likely to take him off the board as a first-round prospect for many defenses. However, what he lacks in measurables, he makes up for with production, natural ability and confidence. He might lack the size teams want from an outside cornerback, but he's more than capable of playing in the slot and playing press, off or zone effectively. Unfortunately for Ekpre-Olomu, the knee injury could hurt his draft stock.",6.10
"Small-school prospects often come with inflated statistics, but Emanuel's tape shows a combination of motor and skill that should be respected inside NFL buildings once he's studied closely. Emanuel has the leverage and hips to get under tackles and turn the corner, but his explosion off the snap will be tested. With his foot quickness and surprising lateral agility, there might be defensive coordinators willing to give him a shot as a 4-3 SAM linebacker.",6.10
NA,NA
"Some evaluators will get caught up on Finney's lack of athleticism, but his hand strength, body composure and ability to stymie athletic interior players with power should not be discounted. These traits will have NFL offensive-line coaches giving him a plug-and-play starting grade.",6.10
"While he might have room on his frame to add more bulk, he's not as long as most 3-4 teams would like at defensive end. His aggressiveness at the point of attack is a plus, but he might have to come off the field on third downs. Limited athletic traits might affect his draft stock.",6.10
"Has mismatch-caliber size, but lack of vertical talent and below-average hands might negate the size to an extent. Funchess was used outside and inside at Michigan and had success from the slot. He has the feel of a hybrid player who can be a big guy at wide receiver or a mismatch nightmare as a move tight end with more weight on his rangy frame.",6.10
"Field corner in college who plays with a great deal of confidence and alertness, processing with above-average instincts. Looks for chances to jump telegraphed throws. Gaines has a thinner frame than desired and will have teams running at him to see if he'll come up and tackle. His cover skills underneath are near the top of this draft class, but he gave up a few open looks on deep balls and that could cause concern for NFL teams.",6.10
"Gallik won't win many footraces and he might not look as good in the uniform as some others will, but he's a street fighter in knee braces and he has the power to handle himself when covered by a 3-4 front. Starting-caliber center in a power running game.",6.10
"A defensive end turned three-technique in a 4-3 defense with outstanding initial quickness off the snap and the hands and feet to be a disruptive, upfield player against plodding guards. Hardison needs more muscle in his lower body and is unlikely to fit defensive schemes looking for stack-and-shed interior defenders. Hardison has starting potential and might be able to come in as a situational pass rusher early on.",6.10
"Productive three-year starter with above-average instincts and football intelligence. Was an interchangeable safety, playing both deep and in run support, but lacks the bulk, physicality and sure tackling to make a living in the box in the NFL. Harris has some coverage limitations in man, but his skills will get him drafted and should also earn him a starting spot fairly quickly.",6.10
"Hundley flashes athleticism and talent, but his basic quarterbacking issues will take time to improve. In 2014, more than 54 percent of his pass attempts were from six yards and in, including 29 percent from behind the line of scrimmage, which is nothing like an NFL offense. Hundley is a ""flash"" prospect who shows the physical tools to be a starter, but his internal clock and issues with reads and progressions must be improved to give him a shot at becoming a decent NFL starter.",6.10
Highly competitive with a history of production at Kansas State. Utilizes great routes and suddenness out of his breaks to get consistent separation. Lockett is a film rat who can come in and compete for a slot receiver spot right away and should be an NFL punt returner.,6.10
"Powerful player with an ability to drive defenders off their spot with leg drive and then torque and finish with strong hands and upper body. Lack of height and arm length could hurt his draft standing a little bit, but his elite power trait as run blocker and solid pass-protection technique make him a future starter at right guard in the NFL.",6.10
NA,NA
"Three-year starter on a well-schooled, talented offensive line. Teams will covet Matias' length and pass-protection traits, as he has the build of a tackle. He uses technique over power. The question is whether he has the hips and athleticism to incorporate more explosiveness in run blocking and improve against change of direction. High-end potential, but not a lock to reach that potential.",6.10
"Miller isn't the most nimble athlete at the guard position and he will be limited by scheme fit, but the pure power in his upper body and his hands have scouts excited and there is a belief that he will be better as a pro than he was in college.",6.10
"Montgomery is a likable person with high character and an ability to leave a positive impression in draft interviews, but teams will still have to figure out how they want to use him. His hands might not be trustworthy enough to be part of a three-wide-receiver set. Montgomery can flip fields and change games with his ability in the return game and might be best-utilized in a dynamic, open-minded offensive system that gets the ball in his hands quickly and allows him to use his run after catch talents.",6.10
"Compact, powerful running back who runs just as powerfully on his 35th carry (back-to-back games of 40 carries) as he does to start the game. While he finishes with brute force, he possesses the vision and lateral movement of a finesse runner. He is more than capable of handling a starter's workload in the NFL, and had Purdue's safeties ready to tap out by the end of that game last season. His character must be vetted carefully, but the tools and the talent are those of a league starter.",6.10
"Evaluators are all over the map on Sambrailo, but I feel like he is an interesting litmus-test player this season. While the feet and movement are pluses, his functional strength could be a hindrance to NFL success. Sambrailo must develop more anchor and power to go with his athleticism or he will get taken advantage of by bull-rushers and edge-setters.",6.10
"Smith possesses above average ball skills and instincts, but questions about his ability to keep up with vertical speed could push his draft stock down a little bit. Smith's cleanest fit might be in a Cover 2 scheme, but he has starting talent.",6.10
"Smith has been a solid, rotational defensive end for Mississippi State, but nothing too special. When studying tape long enough, you see traits and potential. With his long arms, plus hands and ability to play the run, Smith could be an interesting prospect inside or in a hybrid 3-4 front. As a 4-3 defensive end, he lacks the twitch to be an impact player.",6.10
"Tartt has terrific size and is a physical tackler but he must show that he can handle coverage responsibilities. Despite playing 2-deep and single-high coverage, Tartt's size and aggressiveness as a tackler might be best utilized around the line of scrimmage or in a ""robber"" scheme. Tartt has the size, athleticism and overall talent to be an NFL starter.",6.10
"Tomlinson has treated defenders like a squat rep at times, but getting defenders centered and jacked will be tougher in the NFL. His lack of athleticism is a major concern and will cause problems winning initial engagements as defenders will get into him first. Tomlinson's lack of preferred physical traits and a go-to skill set leads me to believe he's more suited to be a backup than full-time NFL starter.",6.10
"Williams is a competitive player with all the football character you want and NFL power to match. When he gets defenders lined up in his sweet spot, he can drive them out of the play. Winning with guile and toughness over skill, Williams' lack of functional athleticism is a concern and might be a catalyst for a move inside to guard.",6.10
NA,NA
"Productive two-year starter who registered 90 tackles during 2014 season thanks to above-average speed and a desire to stick his nose into as many plays as possible. Alexander's lack of instincts were ill-suited in the box, as he was too easily confused by the misdirection of offenses he faced. He's an outside 'backer with a chance to become a starter in a 4-3 defense. He can come in and play on special teams right away.",5.90
"Amos checks all the boxes when it comes to strong football intelligence, a willingness to digest tape and cover skills. The biggest question is whether or not he can fit with a coordinator looking for playmakers and chance-takers. He must prove that he can play with greater overlap. Amos' scheme versatility is a big plus, but I wouldn't ask him to play inside the box very often.",5.90
"Anderson's athleticism and play speed is what NFL teams dream of when looking for tight ends to threaten vertically and create matchup problems underneath. While he needs to add more weight to his frame, Anderson shows the blocking fundamentals to be considered a legitimate combination tight end in the NFL. Anderson's biggest concern on draft day and beyond looks like it could be his recurring triceps injuries.",5.90
Must work on becoming a reliable pass-catcher since he doesn't have the explosive traits for teams to overlook inconsistent hands. Anderson flashes great play speed when the ball is in the air and has the intangibles to become a good backup with low-end starting potential.,5.90
"Anthony has the athleticism to be an NFL linebacker, but he's not an explosive talent. He tries to get downhill and make plays, but more often it feels like he's guessing rather than instinctive. He'll take high-risk chances that will turn some coaches off. Anthony can make it in the league but he might be more of a depth-chart player than a long-time starter.",5.90
"Doesn't have much tread off the tires since arriving to Auburn from junior college. Has proven that he can hit the turbo button and get through creases, but lacks special traits and ability to max out carries. Artis-Payne is a tough runner but I question if he has enough athleticism to be anything more than a grinder and average backup.",5.90
"Lanky, vertical wide receiver with a second gear. He likes to lull cornerbacks to sleep before hitting the gas and getting over the top of them for big plays. Bell is a little more straight-lined than some teams are looking for, but with reliable hands and an ability to make plays on the ball down the field, he has starter's traits as a potential No. 2 WR in the league.",5.90
"Confident, ascending press-cover cornerback with the foot quickness and hips to match receivers off the line of scrimmage and in tight quarters. He's a willing tackler with decent recovery burst, but his questionable long speed and lack of premium size could turn him into a solid slot corner in the league.",5.90
NA,NA
"Cobb's YouTube highlights might bore you, but he's custom-made for physical running teams. He has one-cut traits and can play in a gap scheme. Adjusting his style to the speed of the NFL game might take some time, but Cobb's downhill, run-finishing style fits what running games are becoming again and he has a shot to be more than just a complementary back.",5.90
"Tall receiver lacking blazing speed but showcasing enough acceleration to create separation when challenging upfield. Conley displays a natural feel for the position and has hand strength and body control to make tough, contested catches. Lacked gaudy numbers in run-heavy Georgia offense, but his productivity per catch will certainly be noticed by NFL teams -- especially if he has good timed speed at the NFL Scouting Combine.",5.90
"Cooper must play in a penetrating defensive front in order to minimize his lack of length and maximize his above-average athleticism. He lacks the power to muscle up and hold his ground, but his ability to win with his hands and be a disruptive pass rusher could offer him immediate value as a rotational defensive tackle with a shot to become a starter.",5.90
"Rotational defensive tackle with functional power and enough initial quickness to play in an odd or even front. Covington has played just two years of college football after missing almost the entire 2014 season due to a knee injury. Missing an entire year of football and the injury that caused his absence will both be hills to climb, but he's flashed NFL traits and talent previously.",5.90
"Hard-nosed, high effort tackle whose feet are always in motion and who has the footwork necessary to match up with speed rushers on the left side. Crisp has limited strength and may not be a fit for teams looking to run the ball with power, but his feet and length give him a shot to become an NFL starter at left tackle.",5.90
Smallish slot wide receiver who will have to win with his quickness and route proficiency. Features point-guard quickness and generally solid hands. Has proven his willingness to compete all over the field despite his lack of size.,5.90
"Evaluators and teams might focus on Davis' lack of speed, but his ability to win with his routes should not be undersold. Davis has excellent ball skills and foot quickness and could be a terrific fit for a West Coast offense looking for an outside receiver who can make plays near the goal line.",5.90
"Davison is a powerful defensive tackle who has above-average athleticism and saw his overall production spike in 2014. He is well-conditioned and can play all three downs if called upon to do so. With his athleticism, balance and power, Davison has the potential to be an outstanding pro, but he must prove that he can bring those same traits into play against better competition.",5.90
"Donnal is limited from an athletic and strength standpoint but understands the nuances of the position and how to play with technique. With an ability to pass protect and experience at both guard and tackle, he should be drafted and has a legitimate shot at making a roster.",5.90
NA,NA
"Drummond is a bag of mismatched parts. He has the ball skills and closing burst of a starting NFL free safety, but his instincts and tackling could scare teams away from viewing him as a single-high center fielder. He's not physical enough to play around the line of scrimmage, so his draft position will ultimately rest on how teams weigh his ball skills against his instincts.",5.90
"Tackle-turned-guard who is still learning to play the position. Lack of bend will cause leverage issues, but he has enough pure upper-body strength to overcome and he has potential to be good in pass protection. The physical traits combined with the toughness and intelligence should give him a shot to become a starter at some point.",5.90
"Golden is a square-number pass rusher, meaning there isn't much twist, turn and torque to his game. He comes off the ball with a purpose, but scouts don't see the explosive traits they want from a pass rusher. Golden is primarily an effort and pursuit player with special-teams potential, but he doesn't fill up a stat sheet.",5.90
NA,NA
"Goodley is a top-heavy wide receiver with a running back's frame and an ability to make teams pay after the catch. The biggest concern in scouting circles is how quickly he can adapt to NFL routes and how his hands will hold up if he's asked to make his living over the middle of the field in traffic. Goodley isn't the talent that Percy Harvin is, but he can be used in some of the same, creative ways.",5.90
"Grayson went from fringe draft prospect to clearly on the draft board with a strong 2014 season. Despite average arm talent, he uses good lower-body mechanics to generate velocity and his touch and accuracy on deep throws is eye-opening. Grayson needs more tape work to help improve his decision-making, but his size, production and growth at the position have ticked the requisite draft boxes to make him an intriguing mid-round prospect.",5.90
"Grissom is still very raw and has plenty of football to learn. Some scouts believe he will test well and improve his draft standing beyond where the tape says it should be. He's not a plus pass rusher, but has draftable traits and an untapped upside. His biggest concern could be finding a true position fit.",5.90
"Has the desired size, length and playmaking qualities to be a starting cornerback but his perceived lack of play speed and inconsistency in man coverage could cause teams to peg him as a zone corner, which might drop him by a round.",5.90
"Hardy consistently attacks his on-field responsibility with urgency and aggressiveness and he's a very reliable target. With more teams running the ball out of three-WR sets, some coordinators will see value in the way Hardy gets after run-blocking assignments. Hardy must prove that he has the quickness to get separation out of his breaks.",5.90
"Long-waisted wide receiver who is quicker than fast. Harper was a possession receiver at Fresno State and NFL cornerbacks will likely press him to make him win at the line of scrimmage. With work on his routes, Harper has the feet, body control and hands to get open and become a viable NFL target. His ability to make plays after the catch will improve his draft stock.",5.90
Heuerman's production fell off in 2014 after dealing with a foot injury and quarterback change. He is a vertical pass-catching tight end who can be moved all over the formation. Scouts seem to be unusually intrigued and excited about Heuerman's NFL potential.,5.90
"Hicks sticks to the script and ""plays through a straw"" -- seeing just what is in front of him -- but he has the necessary size, speed and athleticism to stick in the league. Hicks is an improving player who will live in the film room and might end up overdrafted on the upside potential.",5.90
NA,NA
"Improved by leaps and bounds from last year to this after becoming a full-time starter. Plays with competitive toughness and improving confidence in coverage. Hill has the athleticism and ball skills to be an NFL cornerback, but his slight frame is a substantial concern. Concerns surrounding his off-field character could hurt his draft stock.",5.90
"One-year starter at free safety, posting outrageous ball-production numbers. While Byrd is the NFL comparison from a ball-skills standpoint, Holliman doesn't show Byrd's fire or competitiveness. A feast or famine free safety whose lack of field discipline will be more heavily exploited in the NFL, Holliman's ball skills and instincts will surely excite teams, even though his rumored lack of football character could sabotage the talent.",5.90
"His production will jump off the page, but Johnson isn't the high-impact player his tackle numbers might suggest. With average lateral movement and limited twitch, Johnson can be an NFL starter, but is unlikely to be a standout at any point. Off-the-field issues must be monitored as they could sink his draft stock.",5.90
NA,NA
"Physically imposing ""Hulk smash"" linebacker with outstanding power and toughness but a lack of instincts essential to the position. Jones' coverage limitations could be mitigated by his ability to thump and blitz as a 3-4 inside linebacker next to a more instinctive chaser. At worst, Jones is a backup linebacker and core special-teams player.",5.90
Underutilized in the passing game while at Notre Dame. Strong understanding and execution as a run blocker with the physical traits to be a tough matchup in the passing game. Still raw as a receiver and will need more individual work with a position coach on the next level. College production belies his pro potential.,5.90
"Tall, athletic tight end with the frame to add more muscle and the athleticism to get open in space. Kroft is an aggressive blocker who can help the running game win on the edges, but he also possesses the quickness to get open in space and make a play after the catch. Kroft's size, athleticism and competitiveness as a blocker make him a scheme fit for most offenses and he could be one of the top tight ends to come from this draft class.",5.90
"The eyeball test doesn't seem to show Lippett as a dangerous wideout, but he consistently beat Big Ten coverage. Long-strider who excels with slants, posts and in-cuts, he needs work to be more well-rounded with his routes. Lippett's production skyrocketed thanks to hard work, confidence and competitive fire. His willingness to accept the challenge at cornerback and play both ways is an example of why Lippett should succeed as a starter in the league.",5.90
"Productive, consistent four-year starter who plays with the aggressiveness and competitiveness that defensive coordinators will love. Mager has the twitch to close quickly on throws underneath and leaping ability to challenge jump balls. Teams question his ability to carry deep speed, which could impact his draft standing, but his talent and makeup give him a shot at becoming an NFL starter.",5.90
"He needs a year in the weight room, but Mancz is ahead of the game in terms of his understanding of offensive-line play. After playing all three positions, Mancz offers the type of versatility that teams covet, but his average play strength could be a draft-day counter to his versatility. Based on Mancz's tape and history, one would have to expect that he will find a way to succeed in the league.",5.90
"Has the body type and movement of a zone-scheme center with guard potential. Technically sound and has athleticism to become an NFL starter, but must prove he can handle the substantial jump in power and speed he will see.",5.90
"Nelson is tailor-made for the Tampa-2 scheme. An aggressive, physical player in run support who can also limit yards after catch underneath, Nelson does his best work in off coverage. As long as he can keep everything in front of him, Nelson should be able to compete for a starting spot in the league.",5.90
NA,NA
"O'Leary has the competitive spirit and toughness that teams look for in a dual-threat tight end, but he lacks the physical traits. Based on how Florida State used him, he is an easy projection to an H-back spot where he should be an effective move-blocker and pass-catcher.",5.90
Underrated former walk-on with a chip on his shoulder and a mean streak to go with it. Rotational defensive lineman with explosive power coming from relatively modest frame by nose tackle standards. Can play in an odd or even front and has strength and functional quickness to be a factor against the run while creating push and pocket disruption against the pass.,5.90
"One-gap penetrator with serious juice off the snap. Philon could have used an additional year at Arkansas to add muscle and improve himself as a take-on defensive tackle, but teams will absolutely be intrigued by his combination of get-off and interior-pass-rush potential.",5.90
"Improving tackle prospect with athletic limitations that could always hamper his ability to consistently protect the passer as a tackle in the NFL. Played from two-point stance at Utah, but could benefit from a move inside to guard, where he can fire out and play forward. Poutasi will have to learn to sustain blocks and play with faster, stronger hands. Learning those things could take time.",5.90
"Athletic linebacker who falls into a habit of letting plays come to him rather than making things happen. While lacking an aggressive strike as a tackler, Pullard has the athleticism to be a solid NFL player. He has to find a scheme that can keep him clean or he might be just another linebacker.",5.90
"Randall is considered undersized for the safety position and some teams have him projected as a cornerback. While he has the speed and athletic traits to transition to cornerback, his cover skills and technique need quite a bit of work to be ready for the NFL level. Randall has a nose for the ball and a strong desire to make an aggressive tackle in space, so there could still be teams that give him a legitimate shot at safety, where he carries a higher draft grade.",5.90
NA,NA
Watch the tape and his intelligence and toughness immediately stand out. Riggs is a student of the game and displays a field awareness that secondary coaches will covet. The biggest issue for Riggs is that his size might cause some teams to marginalize him and he doesn't have much productivity to hang his hat on. Riggs seems like a perfect fit as a nickel cornerback who can help in run support and who can compete against receivers of all sizes and speeds.,5.90
"Rowe won't be for everyone. Scouts have concerns about his deep speed and he's not a guy who can match and mirror in coverage. However, Rowe will be a nice fit for defenses looking for a long defender with disruptive downfield traits.",5.90
"While Shaw played boundary corner, slot corner and safety at USC, concerns over his athleticism and speed could limit him to zone-cornerback status as a pro. Shaw seems to go along for the ride while on field rather than operate with a voracious appetite to make plays. He's not physical enough to play in the box, so he will likely have to be a Cover-2 cornerback or free safety as a pro.",5.90
NA,NA
"Borderline height to be an outside cornerback and could be looked at as a slot cornerback. His lack of physicality against the run will hurt him with some teams, but his ball skills and college production over the last two years will catch a lot of eyes and gives him a very good shot at making a roster his rookie season.",5.90
"Like Eric Decker, Smelter is a former baseball player with outstanding hand-eye coordination. Both will have entered the draft with questions lingering about a season-ending injury (Lisfranc for Decker). Smelter is an uber-athlete with a background of excellence in every sport he has played. He plays well beyond his experience level at wide receiver. His toughness, natural instincts and football intelligence should earn him a spot on a depth chart, provided there are no lasting effects from his ACL tear.",5.90
"Effort-oriented power end with a willingness to battle and fight at the point of attack. He's not big enough to play end in a 3-4, so he'll have to become an above-average run thumper as a 4-3 power end.",5.90
"When Tavai hits the grass, he goes all out until the final whistle sounds. Limited athleticism could cause decline in production in the pros and medical concerns have some scouts lowering his draft grade. His energy, effort and enthusiasm from snap to snap are characteristics defensive coordinators will welcome at any stage of the draft.",5.90
"Thompson has NFL size and flashes NFL potential, but he doesn't play with the consistency or effort that NFL scouts want to see from him. There will be teams that drop his grade due to football character, but tackles that have traits and upside usually get drafted earlier than their draft grades call for.",5.90
"Redshirt sophomore who relies solely on his outstanding athleticism and physical tools rather than an understanding of how to play the game. If Valles can improve his football intelligence while becoming a more skilled pass rusher, then he should be able to unlock his starter's traits and become a quality NFL edge player. In the short term, Valles will require patience and might not be much of a factor in Year 1.",5.90
"Late bloomer who is faster than quick and has coveted size-speed combination. Waller isn't just a tall receiver, he has legitimate hands and body control and can impose his size on mismatched cornerbacks. Waller has a low floor, but with a little more competitive fire and technique work, he could become a legitimate touchdown maker in the league.",5.90
High-motor interior lineman who could become a five-technique in a 3-4 defense with more technique work. Walton has the traits to become an above-average player against the run and should be able to play in both odd and even fronts.,5.90
"Wilson could use more thump in his game. He will occasionally flash explosiveness, but we don't see it enough. Productive over the last two years, with ability to come in and help on special teams. Attack-
oriented defense could turn Wilson into a more urgent player, but he might have to prove he can be more than just a backup linebacker.",5.90
"Plays with straight-line track speed and is a threat to go over the top of the fastest corners if the get too bold. Alford lacks the short-area elusiveness that would push his draft stock higher, but his speed will open underneath catches and he might be impossible to stay with on crossing routes. He offers value as a kick returner, but must be coached to hit it and go rather than dancing. He might be able to play receiver outside in the right scheme.",5.80
"Workhorse back able to make plays late in the game and work out of the backfield to keep defenses honest. His relative elusiveness in space and ability to cut on a dime give him the ability to create yards where there are none, but his average vision and inability to finish off runs will keep him from getting some of the yards teams might expect. He's well-rounded enough to be a very good backup with middle-
of-the-road starting potential.",5.80
"Big tight end with the size and physical traits of a blocking tight end but lacking the proper disposition to specialize in it. The 2013 tape shows a starting-caliber receiving threat. If he can get quicker and put the work in as a blocker, Boyle can be a starting NFL tight end.",5.80
"North-south runner with a willingness to grab his hard hat and do the dirty work. He's at his best as a high-volume runner who can wear down defenses. He possesses the size, toughness and ability to play on all three downs and that will catch the eyes of teams looking for depth at running back.",5.80
"Intriguing tackle/guard prospect. His mass and athletic limitations are best-suited inside and his quickness off the snap could be an indicator that Brown's best football could be ahead of him. With a wider base and better body control, Brown could become a starting guard or potential tackle in power scheme.",5.80
NA,NA
"Brown has the pure size to block out the sun, and unlike some players with his bulk, he knows how to use it. He can plow holes as a run blocker, but can only play right guard in a power scheme. His lack of playing experience and conditioning concerns could hurt his draft stock.",5.80
NA,NA
Cover corner who is lacking the play strength to handle NFL receivers on the outside and can be mismatched from the slot against physical players. Suspect run support will make playing in the slot tough as well.,5.80
NA,NA
"Box safety with some coverage traits that should help him stick with some of the athletic, matchup-based tight ends. He has shown improved consistency as a tackler and has a knack for creating turnovers. He could come in and earn a spot with special-teams play while he tries to develop his instincts over time.",5.80
"Physical, ball-hawking cornerback who is at his best in bump and run coverage. Celiscar allowed just 35.7 percent of passes his way to be completed in 2014 and posted 33 passes defensed and seven interceptions over last two seasons. His ball skills are no fluke, but his lack of deep speed and fluidity could limit his draft standing and force him into a zone-based defense. It's hard to get a read on his open-field instincts, but it wouldn't surprise to see a team consider him at safety in the pros.",5.80
"A competitive, move tight end with an ability to make contested catches that other tight ends will struggle with. While he won't look as natural and fluid as you would expect, the tape shows a guy who can get separation in space. Has traits to be a quality player who brings diversity and toughness to an offense.",5.80
"Plays with energy and confidence and is a good finisher in run support. Has desired instincts and awareness in coverage, but lacks athleticism to match up against quicker targets in man coverage. Could be tough to cut based on toughness and ability to play on special teams.",5.80
NA,NA
"Patient, pro-style runner with the potential to be a full-time backup and play on all three downs if asked. Play strength is below average for the position, but he's a creative runner who can find yards on his own and catch the ball out of the backfield.",5.80
"Stiff-hipped vertical wide receiver with an ability to make the difficult catch, but a propensity to lose focus when challenged. Davis has the talent to challenge for a back-end roster spot, but his competitive nature is being questioned by some teams.",5.80
NA,NA
"Despite spending only one season at tight end, has the size and tools to become a move tight end who creates matchup issues for defenses. His draft value could be held down due to his lack of experience and below average in-line blocking, but combination of size and play speed should be intriguing to NFL teams.",5.80
Diggs has started 80 percent of his games during his four years at Texas. He's battle-tested against some of the most explosive wide receivers in the country and has developed into a mentally tough player. Diggs will have to be a slot cornerback and will need to keep his weight down in order to match up with the speed he will see from the slot. Diggs is a Day 3 (Rounds 4-7) draft candidate who can help himself by running well in pre-draft drills.,5.80
"Steady four-year starter who was considered a leader in the locker room for Auburn. Is below the acceptable level for quickness, length and size, and his functional strength looks to be just average. Dismukes is a scrappy center who has to win with effort over physical traits.",5.80
"Douglas gets by with adequate length and plus athleticism, but his play demeanor will have to ramp up in order to make it as an NFL guard. Douglas flashes enough potential to excite teams looking for athletic traits, but his lack of functional power will be hard to overlook for others. Douglas could benefit from a glass-chewing mentor in the NFL.",5.80
Has the athletic ability and motor to be effective against the run and was good enough to start for four years in the challenging SEC West. Eulls needs a great deal of improvement as a pass rusher and some of that improvement can come with better hand usage. Has the look of a competent NFL backup.,5.80
"Has competed against outstanding talent during his time in the Big 12 and SEC. Based on tape, he's on the draft fringe. His desire to be the hero might severely hamper his draft stock, but his ability as a hitter and special-teams player should get Everett a look from a zone-based defense. If he can add bulk, safety might be his fallback position.",5.80
"Huge tackle with natural strength and nimble feet. Played just two years of college football and has had to overcome difficult circumstances in his life. His footwork issues will take time to fix and might still be exploited by NFL defenders. Fabuluje might be best served moving inside, where his strength and short-area movement skills will be viewed as big pluses by offensive line coaches.",5.80
"Angular outside linebacker prospect with impressive burst off the snap. He's in need of more bulk before he can be counted on to take on NFL run blockers. Fua could post impressive numbers at the NFL Scouting Combine, and he is a wild card who can be moved around the field by a creative defensive coordinator, but he still needs time to grow into his tall frame and become a more polished pass rusher.",5.80
NA,NA
"Converted center who has taken reps at tackle and started an entire season at guard. Limited phone-booth mauler with above-average upper-body strength and toughness at the point of attack to play in the NFL. His physical limitations could hurt his draft standing, but his functional strength and potential to swing between center and guard give him a decent shot to make it in the league.",5.80
NA,NA
"Thin cornerback who can be a ballhawk when he's in position, but he might have issues sticking with NFL speed. Glenn loves to play and brings everything he's got on every snap. His instincts aren't great, but are serviceable. His ability to tackle with consistency and challenge receivers at the point of contact could earmark him for a spot with a Tampa-2 defense.",5.80
"Boundary corner with press responsibilities in college but might lack the necessary size to play outside and athleticism to star in a primarily man-based scheme in the pros. Grant plays the ball well and is smart, with a willingness to tackle. Could be headed to the slot with a more zone-based defense.",5.80
NA,NA
Scat back with exceptional foot quickness and athleticism. He lacks the size and play strength to handle the rigors of being a first down running back. Heard can mismatch linebackers out of the backfield in the passing game and can create explosive plays as a runner if his blocking is decent. His value to a team will depend directly on scheme.,5.80
Undersized inside linebacker with a big motor and willingness to take chances. Lacks the athleticism to recover from mistakes in the running game and is too tight to cover in space against the pass.,5.80
NA,NA
"Based on the tape, it's hard to imagine Hill will be able to run a time that will make scouts happy. However, he's a tough blocker and a reliable, big target who can block in the running game. Hill's medicals will be scrutinized, but if healthy, he could use his big frame to muscle smaller slot corners.",5.80
Hull is a productive linebacker who might be forced to stay inside due to his lack of athleticism. His size and short arms concern some scouts because they fear he'll get overwhelmed on second level and give up too many big runs. Hull has enough talent to make it in the league as a backup linebacker/special-teams contributor.,5.80
"Johnson lacks the short-area quickness to be a consistently effective every-down running back, but he has good size, speed and hands so he can't just be dismissed. He doesn't run routes well enough and isn't sudden enough to be a wide receiver, so he might have to be a third-down back with kick-return potential.",5.80
NA,NA
"Instinctive cornerback with good size and adequate speed. Has the ball skills and anticipation needed for the position. Jones' balance and overall athleticism could be a concern in man coverage and his season-ending shoulder injury will need to be examined. He would be an interesting free safety prospect with his instincts, but might lack the physicality for the position.",5.80
"Has very good athleticism for a big running back and is a physical pile-mover who is difficult to stop for negative yardage. Unfortunately, Jones lacks the instincts and vision to fully maximize his physical tools. Jones could become the physical member of a running-back-by-committee approach, with upside as a third-down option.",5.80
"While Kouandjio has been part of a successful team at Alabama, that doesn't mean he is ready to take that next step. At times it's painful to watch Kouandjio try to move in space and he's limited to blocks that are right in front of him. His lack of functional athleticism and versatility will limit his NFL chances.",5.80
NA,NA
"Langford showed improvement from 2013 to 2014, but he doesn't accelerate through contact and will usually get what is blocked. Without an ability to maximize his yards with each carry, teams could peg him as a ""committee back"" with an ability to play on third downs.",5.80
"Lefeld looks the part, with his confident kick-slide and technically sound hands, but lack of functional strength and length is a concern. With coaching, Lefeld could play with better leverage, but functional power will continue to get him knocked off balance.",5.80
NA,NA
NA,NA
"Skilled pass rusher who understands the position and was simply too athletic and too talented for most of the competition he faced while at Tennessee-Chattanooga. Is a natural fit as a three-technique in a 4-3 defense, but could garner consideration as a 3-4 defensive end if he can prove he's strong enough.",5.80
NA,NA
"Has an NFL body and the speed and quickness that offensive coordinators want out on the field, but he has barely scratched the surface of what it will take to make it in the league. Scouts like his work ethic and believe that he will be coachable. He might be a year or two away from making a difference as a receiver, but his kick-return potential could get him on the field sooner.",5.80
"Tall, rhythm thrower who shows an ability to play with confidence and accuracy when used as a game manager within an offense featuring a strong rushing attack. Mannion needs plays to stay on schedule or his confidence becomes shaky and the turnovers start rolling in. Mannion lacks arm talent to carry an offense, but has enough ability to become a capable backup.",5.80
"Intriguing conversion prospect who is moving from quarterback to cornerback in an effort to make it in the NFL. It will take time for Marshall to go from a position of decision-making, patience and processing to one of frenetic energy and high-end athleticism. Marshall flashed at cornerback during Senior Bowl practices and his size will interest NFL teams, but his top-end speed and individual workouts will determine whether he's an NFL cornerback or a name-brand former college quarterback.",5.80
NA,NA
"Teams will have to answer questions about his level of ability to get open because he has the art of catching the ball down pat. Vertical speed and separation quickness appear to be average considering his competition level, so teams must figure out whether to keep him outside or utilize his size and toughness over the middle in the slot.",5.80
Undersized slot corner with instincts to anticipate and the twitch and ball skills to do something about it. Much more comfortable processing and attacking from an off position and loses effectiveness when forced to play with his back to the ball. His 19 passes defensed and 11 interceptions over his last 22 starts are indicative of his athleticism and talent to play on the next level but he could be scheme dependent.,5.80
"All-purpose running back with a lean frame and a big heart. Showed consistency of effort and production during his time at Missouri. His value as a runner is limited due to his size, but he has the potential to become a legitimate target out of the backfield and might warrant some reps in camp as a slot receiver. Murphy can step in and immediately challenge for the top spot as a kickoff and/or punt returner.",5.80
"Myers is already above average from a technical standpoint and is a quick processor when the game speeds up. Myers is a guard prospect who can pull and play in a power scheme. He has the pass protection traits of an NFL starter. The ceiling is higher for Myers than many guard prospects in this draft, and with more coaching and work in the weight room, he should be an NFL starter.",5.80
NA,NA
NA,NA
"Athletic interior lineman with an ability to become a more disruptive penetrator with more coaching and improved technique. He will probably be targeted by one-gap, upfield defenses. His maturity level will be questioned at the NFL Scouting Combine and beyond. The way he handled his situation at Florida could sink his draft prospects, but it shouldn't sink his chance to make a team and become an NFL backup.",5.80
NA,NA
"Schemed dependent cornerback who is best-suited to a bump and run or cover-2 defense due to his length and disruptive nature off the line of scrimmage. Peters doesn't have great play strength and is a willing tackler more than an aggressive hitter, but he plays with desired competitiveness and hasn't allowed a touchdown pass against him over his last 58 targets spanning two years. If Peters can run an average forty yard dash and add some bulk to his frame, he has the potential to become a starter.",5.80
"NFL evaluators felt like Petty's senior season was disappointing, but those same evaluators love his size, leadership and intangibles. He needs a year or two of practice time and camp work to learn how to get through his progressions, but has the intelligence to do that. Petty must have a structured offense that won't ask him to make plays outside of the pocket.",5.80
"Prewitt is a four-year starter who has been a dependable and productive member of an improving unit at Ole Miss. His size screams ""box safety"" but his play demeanor doesn't. He lacks the athleticism and plus instincts to be a chance-taker at the next level and will likely have to fit with teams as a single-high and Cover 2 safety.",5.80
"Reed never developed into the type of defensive end that Texas expected when it recruited him. Despite having a viable NFL frame, Reed hasn't been able to show enough on tape to earn a plus grade for any of the critical or secondary traits teams are looking for from a defensive end. However, his improvement during his senior season could give teams enough hope to take a shot.",5.80
"A limited, run-support safety whose coverage issues could be an issue for NFL teams looking for diverse safety play. He's a willing tackler who plays with range in run support, but Richards' lack of instincts and ability to stick receivers in space could limit his NFL opportunities.",5.80
NA,NA
"Hulking tackle, but needs to do more with it. Doesn't have the kick-slide to consistently get out to meet speed off the edge, and when faced with inside moves, he struggles to move feet and secure the gap. Foot quickness could benefit if he trimmed down, but a move inside could be considered if teams feel like he can play with enough bend.",5.80
"He's got the size, physicality and commitment to film work to play inside, but his instincts still need work. Ryan is a little stiff and stays blocked for too long, but his disengagement from blocks will improve with more reps inside. Faster than quick, he is scheme versatile and can fit inside or at the SAM linebacker spot in a 4-3. Ryan's productivity comes from toughness, play demeanor and physical tools. Teams could pigeonhole him as a ""try-hard"" linebacker, but they shouldn't.",5.80
He can mirror in pass protection and takes good angles that help him get to his zone-blocking responsibilities. He's a worker bee who can use technique and effort to win more snaps than he should against more talented players. He can be an NFL backup with the potential to become a starter.,5.80
"Raw but athletic tight end with above-average leaping ability and open-field talent to stress defenses vertically. While he played in-line and standing, he looked much more comfortable as a stand-up tight end. Sifrin could improve rapidly with a committed approach and NFL coaching, but he has a very limited career window due to his age, which could push him way down on some draft boards.",5.80
"The frame of a guard and the skill set of a guard probably means Smith will end up moving to guard. His hands need work, but with power as his calling card and the ability to hide some of his athletic deficiencies by moving him inside, he has a good shot of getting drafted and fighting for a backup spot.",5.80
"Spaight played two years of JUCO football and started just two games as a junior at Arkansas. This past season was his first as a full-time starter and he is still learning the nuances of the position. He's physical and productive between the tackles, but might be limited when asked to make plays on the perimeter.",5.80
"Gangly cornerback with spindly legs but a willingness to play physically and with great energy and effort. Swann doesn't play tightly enough in coverage or make enough plays on the ball to be a starting cornerback and doesn't have the size to transition to safety full time, but he's versatile and highly competitive and has a legitimate shot to make a team.",5.80
"Trinca-Pasat is a three-year starter who saw his productivity take a big jump his senior season thanks to a more aggressive scheme and consistency of effort. His play traits are worthy of draft consideration, but his lack of size will be something that will have to be countered with scheme. He works inside the construct of a defensive scheme exceptionally well and defensive coaches will love his hustle.",5.80
NA,NA
"Tull uses smarts, skill and toughness to dominate his level of competition. Tull has the athleticism to play outside linebacker in an odd front and his relentless nature and ability to outplay expectations could make him an NFL surprise.",5.80
Former high school wide receiver who still plays the game with a wide receiver's mindset rather than a tight end's. Must get tougher and more physical to become a serviceable in-line blocker but that might not happen. Underutilized in Auburn's limited passing game and could become a much more productive move tight end in the pros than he was in college.,5.80
"All-purpose running back with an ability to hit big plays from time to time, but no value as an every-down player. Some teams might view Williams as a luxury talent with minimal value due to his lack of size and natural position fit, while other teams will see him as a chess piece that they can deploy to create mismatches and use to stress defenses. His kick-return ability adds value, but there's likely a ceiling on just how highly he will be drafted.",5.80
"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit.",5.80
"When evaluators look at small-school prospects, they want to see them dominate that level of competition and that is exactly what Zenner was able to do. Zenner is more fast than sudden and might be best-suited in a one-cut scheme. His production, size and speed will generate plenty of discussion in draft meetings.",5.80
NA,NA
"Base end in college who might lack the natural pass-rushing ability or strength at the point of attack to play defensive end in the NFL. Barnes appears to have enough athleticism to transition to 3-4 outside linebacker, but he must improve his hand usage and become more skilled as a pass rusher to fit into a 3-4 role.",5.60
NA,NA
Phone-booth fighter with scheme limitations. Has strength to handle himself in a power-based scheme and is technically sound in pass protection. Ability to play center and guard gives him a decent shot of making an NFL roster.,5.60
"A newly converted tight end who was a short-yardage specialist and red-zone brute for the Sooners as a quarterback. Bell was looked over by scouting community during the regular season, but he has flashed sure hands and shown improvement as a blocker and could have an NFL future if a team is willing to be patient with him.",5.60
Angular cornerback with easy moving hips and feet to mirror and match off the line of scrimmage. He's not big enough to press and could get mismatched by size or rushing attacks if moved to the slot. Has the traits to make an NFL roster as a backup.,5.60
NA,NA
"Competitive and aggressive sub-package corner with man-cover skills and a willingness to do what is necessary to stay on the field. His size likely puts a ceiling on his draft stock, but the tape should have teams giving him a draftable grade.",5.60
NA,NA
"Has NFL size and NFL intangibles but might not possess the necessary physical traits to project into a starter's role in the NFL. His competitiveness, intelligence and production will matter more to teams that are less reliant on traits-based quarterbacks. Might be looking at a career as a quality backup.",5.60
NA,NA
"Technically sound player who lacks the desired burst and pass-rush skills to be a full-time defensive end and needs more bulk to play inside. Chickillo could use more length, but with his arm extension and strength at the point of attack, he could find his way as a backup strong-side defensive end in a 4-3.",5.60
NA,NA
"Daniels suspension and then dismissal over academic dishonesty will need to be looked into, but the tape shows a receiver who is still learning to run better routes and maximize his size. Daniels lacks plus athleticism or speed and missing an entire year of football puts him behind in his wide receiver studies. His production and size could get him a look but he will likely need time to sharpen his skills as a receiver before he is ready to contribute.",5.60
"Davis does his best work after the throw is in the air, with terrific awareness and body control. His problem is that he doesn't do anything special before the throw to get open. He doesn't have the feet or acceleration to free himself, so he will have to learn to body up defenders more effectively and become special with his hands in order to be an NFL backup.",5.60
NA,NA
"Used as a 3-4 outside backer at times and as a defensive end when Alabama goes to it's even front, Dickson has adequate skills as a pass rusher, but is average to below average against the run. Dickson doesn't feature the explosive, athletic traits to be a pass rushing specialist and might not have enough strength at the point of attack to be an every down defensive end.",5.60
NA,NA
"If he can get back to his level of play from 2013, then he is a draftable player who has movement and power traits that give him a chance to earn playing time in the NFL. Dieffenbach's 2014 tape will scare many teams and his medicals will be closely scrutinized, but his recovery and potential might be worth a late-round pick.",5.60
NA,NA
"Has the lower body of a defensive end, but lacks the talent and athleticism to make that his home. Has enough strength at the point of attack to be a 3-4 defensive end but is unlikely to be a plus play against the run or pass from that position.",5.60
NA,NA
"Tall safety with average instincts and average speed to chase throws over the top and range from hash to sideline. Eskridge plays with enough desire as a tackler to warrant a draft pick, but he’s got to prove that he has a bankable skill in the box or in coverage to go along with his size.",5.60
NA,NA
"Active, physical safety with short-area coverage ability and a willingness to get his hands dirty near the line of scrimmage. Geathers has the talent to play in the league but he makes too many mistakes to be trusted just yet and might need a year or two of seasoning and development.",5.60
NA,NA
Explosive athlete with only one year of experience at defensive end after transitioning from wide receiver. Gwacham lacks the functional strength to play the run and he's still in the infant stages of learning how to rush the passer. His desire and character combined with his superb physical traits could make him a late-round project who teams show patience with as he gets bigger and continues to learn the position.,5.60
"Hackett has limited speed and is thinner than desired for the position. He has some holes in coverage and isn't going to come up and thump as a run supporter, but there are some personnel men that think highly of him as a potential playmaker at the next level.",5.60
"Isn't going to get teams excited with his size, play speed or hands, but he's willing to do whatever is asked of him and flashes enough potential to be viewed as a developmental prospect.",5.60
"Lanky ""system quarterback"" lacking a strong arm and an ability to create plays outside of the pocket. Halliday shows an adequate level of football intelligence and has enough accuracy to warrant a draft pick. One positive is that he has clearly improved over the last two seasons and might continue on the same track once he works into an NFL system. A role as a backup might be his ceiling.",5.60
"Outstanding athlete who dominated the competition on the FCS level with athleticism and sound technique. Hamilton's lack of length could force him inside and once there, he must prove he's strong enough to handle himself. His athleticism and steady technical work might put him ahead of the curve as far as zone-running teams are concerned and his best position could well be center if he's able to snap it.",5.60
"Young, soft-bodied prospect who is best suited to play guard in the NFL. Tape doesn't always treat Hart kindly, but his issues in pass protection as a tackle won't be same issues he faces in the NFL as a guard. While he has physical limitations, Hart is a competitive player who flashes NFL power potential.",5.60
"Heinicke has the ball placement and accuracy of an NFL backup when he's protected and dealing, but his small stature combined with his inability to drive the ball and make NFL throws could be hard to overcome once he gets into an NFL camp. Heinicke must play in a timing-based system to have a chance of being on an NFL roster.",5.60
NA,NA
"Undersized inside linebacker who doesn't use his instincts to play a downhill, attack-oriented brand of football. Herrera has a nose for the ball and a motor that keeps him in most plays, but he lacks the bulk to carry through with his desire to play physically and too much of his tackle production comes down the field. He is best-suited as a backup inside linebacker with an ability to play on kick-coverage teams.",5.60
NA,NA
"High-cut college tackle who could struggle badly in pass protection if left at that position in the pros. If he were a little more athletic, he could be an interesting center prospect in the Chris Myers mold. As an NFL prospect, he won't check off many of the boxes teams are looking for in terms of his natural talent.",5.60
"The change of direction and edge-bending potential are both there, but Hodges is still very raw and lacks the functional strength to set the edge as a 3-4 outside 'backer. He appears to be a project who must live in the weight room in order to be able to become a more complete physical talent.",5.60
"Big, in-line tight end with room on his frame for more muscle, but he's limited by a lack of functional athleticism and a mechanical play demeanor. James isn't a plus receiver with great hands and he lacks the quickness to consistently free himself from man coverage, so he must become a more determined run blocker in order to have a shot at starting in the NFL.",5.60
"Productive, yet limited, three-year starter with a nose for the ball and a willingness to play a physical brand of football. He can be a liability in coverage and will have to be covered up by scheme, but he's an absolute bulldog around the line of scrimmage and can play on special teams right away.",5.60
"Called a ""self-made man"" and ""tremendously tough"" by his head coach. Rarely gives the opposing offensive lineman a snap off, but his game is based on good hand work and raw effort rather than athleticism and raw talent. If Larsen can add more weight, he might be able to become a rotational defensive end in a 3-4 defense.",5.60
NA,NA
"An ""X"" receiver in college who will likely be forced into the slot based on lack of desired size and speed. Has NFL hands, but his lack of physical traits might make it tough to overcome concerns about work ethic and well-traveled background.",5.60
"Limited, dime-a-dozen running back who will get some attention from teams for his willingness to stick his nose into blitzers and protect the quarterback on third downs. Has just three kickoff returns over last two seasons, so he's likely a camp body who must find a way to shine with limited reps.",5.60
NA,NA
Loves football and brings physicality and competitiveness to each snap. Limited in coverage and as a functional athlete. His best bet is to make it as a situational sub and core special-teamer.,5.60
NA,NA
"Mbu will outwork many of the defensive tackles in this draft, but the question is whether his effort level can make up for his inability to dominate against the run or as a pass rusher. Mbu's football character and size give him a shot to make an NFL team.",5.60
"The instincts, confidence and competitiveness are all there, but his coverage skills need major work and his lack of size could preclude him from making a living near the line of scrimmage. He has the mental makeup, but comes up a little short on the physical side. His desire and instincts give him a shot to make a roster, but he needs to add more bulk.",5.60
NA,NA
NA,NA
"He doesn't have the length or athleticism to make it as an NFL tackle, so he he'll likely have to make the switch to guard. Has smarts and hands to play guard or center, but his lower body power must improve. With coaching, Miller could be a serviceable interior backup.",5.60
NA,NA
"Morse relies on timing, instincts and angles to get guys blocked as a tackle on the college level but might lack the arm length and functional athleticism to play tackle in the pros. If he moves inside to guard, his toughness will serve him well, but he's not a power player and must prove that he can sustain his block and positioning to be an effective run blocker.",5.60
NA,NA
"Competes and plays with toughness and above-average play strength for his size, but needs more bulk to play defensive end. Will likely be slotted as a 3-4 SAM outside linebacker but lacks the twitch to be a full-time player.",5.60
NA,NA
"After a couple of productive college seasons, Norwood saw his playing time and production slashed in 2014 due to competition at the position. While he has the hands and the toughness, scouts believe he is a limited receiver who needs a good workout to get back on draft radars.",5.60
"Fireplug with a good motor and an ability to find gaps and drive upfield through them. He's missing the size and brute strength necessary to consistently handle himself in phone booth battle so he will have to play in a one-gap, upfield defense. He has the look of a penetrating nose who will have to start his career as a backup.",5.60
"Nzeocha has a tremendous amount of athleticism and speed, but his instincts for the game must be developed and sharpened before he can be trusted as a full-time starter. His potential and ceiling are exciting (provided he recovers from injury), but he's the textbook definition of project. Like the Eagles' Bryan Braman, he has the length and speed to become a highly effective special-teams player.",5.60
"Aggressive box safety with adequate ability in man coverage underneath. However, he could struggle if asked to cover downfield. Parms charges downhill -- he will race to the action against the run and is a reliable tackler. He's almost too disciplined in his approach and doesn't have the instincts or willingness to cheat in coverage to create more opportunities for plays on the ball.",5.60
"Raciti had a big sophomore season but struggled when he was shifted to a 3-4 defense as a junior. In 2014, Raciti moved back to a 4-3 and attacked upfield again. Raciti has to go up or down in weight because he's not big enough to survive at the point of attack on the inside. Some evaluators see value in Raciti slimming down and bouncing outside to a 3-4 strong-side linebacker spot.",5.60
"Rasco doesn't have the pass-rush talent to draw a great deal of excitement leading up to the draft, but he keeps his eyes glued to the backfield and he is rarely out of position. Rasco can use his toughness, football acumen and quickness to compete for a spot with a blitz-happy, complex defense as a 3-4 OLB.",5.60
Compact running back with squatty lower body and a short-striding style that allows him to get to his top speed quickly in the open field. Robinson appears to be lacking an NFL burst and the shiftiness needed to create more yardage for himself on the second level. He has good short-area footwork and is effective as a pass-catcher but is lacking a differentiating talent from the rest of the backs in this draft.,5.60
NA,NA
"Decorated four-year punter with outstanding size, and consistent accuracy and touch when needed. Despite having just one punt blocked during time at Baylor, he might need to speed things up when he hits the next level.",5.60
NA,NA
"Physical box safety with good meat on the bones and a willingness to play physical football. Sample is stymied by his lack of football experience which plays into his lack of instincts and coverage talent at his position. Sample shows good play speed and ability to range, but needs more time to develop into a more complete player.",5.60
NA,NA
"Saxton has traits that have opened the eyes of some scouts. He can run and has the length and hands of an NFL tight end. His biggest draft obstacle is that his willingness and/or ability to compete as a run blocker limits his value to a team. Saxton needs to get bigger and show a greater commitment to improving all facets of his game. For now, he is a developmental prospect with athletic traits.",5.60
NA,NA
"An undersized, move quarterback who can make plays outside of the pocket. Has enough arm to threaten defenses over the top. Though up and down at times, Sims has demonstrated enough potential to warrant a look as an NFL backup in a draft class sorely lacking in quarterback prospects.",5.60

"Heady inside linebacker mindful of assignments in scheme-oriented Stanford defense. Nothing special about his size, athleticism or competitiveness on tape and lack of downhill metrics could limit his draft prospects despite his steady play. Has backup potential in the league.",5.60
"Taylor is a productive, outside-the-numbers vertical threat with an ability to sting a defense after the catch. Needs work, but is a plus athlete with great height and an ability to separate. Must prove he can get off press coverage and play stronger in order to become viable NFL receiver.",5.60
"Long, angular cornerback with a willingness to tackle and an understanding of how to play the game, but his lack of functional speed could doom him at cornerback in the NFL. If he can fill out his thin frame with more muscle, he might have a shot at transitioning to safety, but his body type doesn't look ready for that move just yet.",5.60
NA,NA
"Teams will be forced to draft Trail on projection rather than tape. While his production looks good on paper, Trail never stands out as a dominant force. He failed to flash at the Senior Bowl as a defensive player but took some reps near the goal line as a tight end, which could be his best chance to make a team and stick in the league.",5.60
"Could get pushed into the fullback genre when, in reality, he's a running back and an instinctive one at that. Varga's ability to run and catch gives him a shot at the back end of a depth chart, but he might have to show he can take snaps as a move fullback and shine on special teams to make an NFL team.",5.60
NA,NA
"Vitabile has shorter than desired arm length for an NFL frame. His lack of length could hurt his ability to  sustain blocks and get into nose tackles first. Run blocking could be a series of stalemates for him, but he has balance and anchor to be capable pass blocker and should compete for a roster spot.",5.60

"High school speedster who appears to have lost a step since his 2012 knee injury, but who is still quick enough and athletic enough to find the open spaces and make yards after the catch. While his injury history could very well be a draft deterrent, White's talent should get him a look and give him a shot to make a team. He might have to return kicks to prove his worth early on.",5.60
"High-cut developmental prospect at defensive tackle who plays with the motor and toughness that teams will love, but he is still in need of more seasoning and growth. As he competes against better competition, he could show quite a bit of improvement.",5.60
NA,NA
"Fills the stat sheet, but is missing traits associated with becoming a starting linebacker in the NFL. He is an average athlete with average speed and loses leverage in his run responsibilities. He's a willing chaser and he's around the action, so a move to the WILL outside 'backer spot might make the most sense in order to limit his liability against downhill rushing attacks.",5.60
NA,NA
"Andrews is a three-year starter and a quality football player. He's a consistent performer who will have to find a fit with a zone scheme rushing attack because of his lack of NFL mass and power. Andrews has enough skill to play in the league, but his small frame will be a non-starter for some teams.",5.50
"Bibbs flashed some productivity with the Cyclones over the last two seasons, but he is a below-average athlete without eye-catching potential as a run blocker. Bibbs will have to prove he can be a viable NFL blocker to make it as a tight end and he might end up getting a look as a fullback.",5.50

"Space-eater who can eat blocks up but won't spit out much production. Is a liability as a pass rusher and might need to add more mass to lock in as a pure, two-gap nose who can help to keep linebackers clean.",5.50
NA,NA
"A mauler who will have to kick down from right tackle to guard due to his lack of functional athleticism in pass protection. His struggles with changing direction and handling active defenders and twists will still be a problem inside. Bond is unable to block in space, so he will likely be confined to competing for a spot on a power-run-only team.",5.50
NA,NA
"Brown has experience at both tackle and guard, but he'll be limited to playing guard in the NFL. Brown doesn't show much potential to be a block-winner as a pro, but he has enough size and ability to get into a camp and compete for a backup spot.",5.50
NA,NA
"Slot receiver lacking suddenness to get open against man coverage underneath, but with a second gear to find separation on deep throws. Clay's size and playmaking ability as a receiver aren’t going to do much for most teams, but his return ability gives him a shot at making a team.",5.50
NA,NA
"It isn't easy to maintain a starting position for four years in the SEC unless a player is competitive and tough. Day's competitive nature, toughness and football intelligence give him a shot, but his lack of athleticism could make it difficult for him to finish assignments consistently as a pro.",5.50
"Delaire could add weight and look to become a base end in a 4-3, but he flashed the athleticism and strength to warrant a look as an edge-setting 3-4 outside linebacker with explorable traits as a pass rusher. His NFL Scouting Combine and personal workouts might determine whether or not he is drafted.",5.50
NA,NA
"Burly and thick through his middle, DePriest needs plays to unfold in front of him to play at his best. With offenses becoming matchup-oriented, DePriest's value to an NFL team could be diminished. Best-suited as a two-down ILB in a 3-4 defense.",5.50
"Edwards has the size to be an NFL back and he was a consistent producer within his conference, but his marginal play speed and tendency to drift towards the line of scrimmage could cause him to get captured more quickly than desired for a starting running back. He has the traits to be a backup, but must show special teams ability and improved pass protection.",5.50
"Productive run-pass quarterback who was forced to carry a substantial percentage of the offensive success on his shoulders. His confidence and accuracy dipped in 2014 and he lacks the poise and arm to become a starter in the league. He's a willing learner and has a chance to be a third quarterback with ""package"" potential thanks to his toughness as a runner.",5.50
"Fowler plays a dying position and doesn't offer elite blocking downhill or on the move. His ability to catch the ball and be a core special-teams player makes him a viable contender for a roster spot, even though it might be as an undrafted free agent.",5.50
"Heady player with potential position versatility, but lacking an area where he truly excels. His foot quickness and movement skill will appeal to zone-scheme teams but he must improve his strength and ability in pass protection if he wants to be anything more than a backup.",5.50
"With his burst to the ball and ability to cover, Hager would be best suited for a 4-3 defense looking for an athletic linebacker who can make plays outside of his area. Hager might end up a late-round pick, but teams like his production and chase traits.",5.50
"Undersized runner with a big back's fearlessness. Hart is a gritty, determined player who fought his way back from two injuries to the same knee and a lack of playing time at Alabama before transferring. He was highly productive in his one year at Colorado State, but could have a hard time making a roster due to his lack of size and pro-caliber quickness.",5.50

"Kilgo's frame carries his weight well, but he's missing the power necessary to play the nose. Kilgo rarely threatens the gap as a penetrator and he struggles to hold up against double teams. Kilgo's lack of aggressive temperament and pure strength could make him a tough sell on draft day.",5.50

"Very good athlete whose background as a basketball player is obvious in his body control and positioning. Has good hands and is tough to bring down but will need time to develop against a higher level of competition, despite his potential to play in the league.",5.50
"Decorated Division II tackle prospect who might have to move to center to have any shot in the NFL. As an NFL guard, Manhart would be athletic enough for a zone scheme, but NFL scouts have grave concerns about his ability to drop anchor and handle power from the inside. Manhart could be a late-round target or priority free agent with practice-squad potential as a center.",5.50
NA,NA
"Came into UCLA as a heralded five-star recruit and is leaving school after three seasons with just eight starts including none this past season. McCarthy has size that will plant him on some draft boards, but he lacks skill as a pass rusher and hasn't proved that he can venture from a phone booth to make plays. McCarthy's knees will need to be checked closely, but the bigger concern could be his weight problems and whether or not he has the desire to do what it takes to be a player in the league.",5.50
NA,NA
"Can line up in a variety of spots. Offers formation versatility and a willingness to do the dirty work as a blocker. He won't do much on the ground after the catch, but he has reliable hands and the competitive temperament to give himself a legitimate shot of making a roster, likely for a West Coast offense.",5.50
"The production is impressive. It warrants attention and accolades, but the tape shows an alarming inconsistency of effort and competitive fire. Pruitt won't be considered a plus athlete for the position by NFL standards, so he must crank up the motor and keep it running -- especially when asked to block since that might be his way onto a team.",5.50
He's a man-cover cornerback with willingness to tackle and below-average instincts and awareness. Riley lacks the twitch to recover when beaten and his instincts aren't good enough to put him into position to make plays on the ball. Needs more film study and will likely need time on a practice squad to have a shot.,5.50

"Versatile linebacker with good play speed and a motor that teams look for. While Ball's play clearly improved from 2013 to 2014, his physical issues will be tough to overcome by draft day. He overcame losing both of his parents before the age of 10 as well as brain surgery in 2011, so he's no stranger to adversity and perseverance. Ball might have to attempt to beat the odds once again and make a roster via the undrafted-free-agent route.",5.40

"Big back who doesn't usually run like it and rarely imposes his will on second-level tacklers. Content to do just enough to get by, according to key evaluators in the league, and his loss of playing time was about effort and work ethic, which isn't going to sit well with NFL teams. Brown's size gives him a shot, but he doesn't have the creativity as a runner to make it if power isn't his calling card in the NFL.",5.40
Outside receiver with limited speed and athleticism who is heavily reliant upon his outstanding hands. Unlikely to be able to be able to find separation on the next level without requisite quickness.,5.40
NA,NA
Phone-booth run blocker who shows an understanding of angles and footwork to overcome his slow feet and get to the edge against speed.

"Cox used his speed to dominate at the JUCO level, but he wasn't able to post the same level of production while at Mississippi State.

Some of his issues are coachable, which means he should make it into a camp if he runs well.",5.40
NA,NA
"Herring will flash, but there just isn't enough tape showing consistency or productivity to value the ""flash"" beyond the surface. Herring lacks the size and consistent explosion into the gaps to forecast him as anything more than a backup, at best.",5.40
NA,NA
"Tight-hipped, straight line cornerback-turned-safety who has a nose for getting in on tackles, but who lacks the athleticism and cover skills teams will be looking for from starting safeties. Jefferson's best shot could be to improve his instincts from safety spot, become a trusted tackler and make a name for himself on special teams.",5.40
NA,NA
"Compact running back with power in his lower body to break tackles and extend runs, but he's not a chain-moving power runner with a desire to punish tacklers. Tape shows borderline athletic ability as a pro with little to no value as a third-down back, which limits his draft value.",5.40
NA,NA
Outside receiver who lacks the athleticism and route sharpness to be anything more than a vertical receiver who tries to win with size and ball skills down the field. Lack of deep speed will make becoming an NFL receiver a difficult task unless he's able to create more separation through route running.,5.40
NA,NA
An athletically limited safety with the demeanor to play near the line of scrimmage but currently lacks the bulk to do so consistently as a tackler. Technique needs a ton of work in coverage and could limit his ability to make a roster until he improves in that area.,5.40
NA,NA
"A game-managing pocket passer with arm strength that is below the desired NFL level. Must play in timing-
based offense. Mason displays the football intelligence, accuracy and poise worthy of an NFL camp. Must prove his intangibles can overcome his lack of arm.",5.40
NA,NA
"Early entrant to the draft who has NFL-ready size, but is lacking NFL-caliber strength. Moore doesn't play with enough bend to be able to mitigate those strength issues with technique, and his feet are very average in the run game.",5.40
NA,NA
"Tough, instinctive inside linebacker with a great feel for where the play is going but limitations on converting instincts into tackles. Doesn't disengage well enough to be a roster factor and must take more chances on getting to the spot first to have a shot to make a team.",5.40
NA,NA
Athletic fullback who can be used in the play-action passing game out of the backfield. Neighbors plays with patience and intelligence and could have a role on special teams as well.,5.40
"Rail-thin slot receiver at the next level, but missing the suddenness and ""after-the-catch"" talent desired for that position. Getting drafted might be a long shot, but his kick-return numbers will have teams taking a close look at him as a specialist.",5.40

"Was able to keep punts from finding the end zone, but was inconsistent with how he struck the ball and his directional punting.",5.40
NA,NA
"A JUCO transfer lacking athleticism to play on the left side, Poole might get a shot at right tackle but is better suited for a move inside. With more strength and experience, Poole has a shot to make a practice squad and potentially work his way up the ladder.",5.40
Riddick played out of position as a five-technique in West Virginia's defense and was simply not big enough for the position. His burst upfield is undeniable and he could become a practice-squad project as a 3-4 outside linebacker or a wide-9 in an even front with upfield potential.,5.40
NA,NA
"Old-school blocking back who will have a hit or two each game that wows the crowd and gets his teammates fired up. He often charges in head-first and with a lowered head, so his success rate can vary greatly from game to game. Lack of pass-catching background hurts his chances.",5.40
NA,NA
"Played right tackle at Boston College, but is better suited to be a guard due to his power and lack of foot quickness. Silberman has some physical limitations, but he has the balance and natural power that should intrigue NFL teams.",5.40
"Big-bodied defensive tackle who could find a home as a two-gapping nose guard in a 3-4. Simon is 24 years old and is coming off of a knee injury, but he has noticeable power and shows potential to slow the run in the middle of a defense. He needs much better pad level and plenty of coaching for his potential to be unlocked.",5.40
NA,NA
"Average athletic traits with decent ball skills but a substantial deficiency in play strength. West Virginia peppered Smith with hitches to wide receiver Kevin White and Smith was unable to respond favorably. He can make it into a camp, but likely lacks enough meat on his bones to become a roster factor.",5.40

NA,NA
"Scouts say Stanford coaches have nice things to say about Vaughters as a teammate, but tape work shows too many athletic deficiencies to overcome and his draft position might reflect that as well.",5.40
NA,NA
"Only had 20 catches during 2014 season and tape shows a player who isn't even remotely draftable. Medicals will be combed over at the NFL Scouting Combine, but if his health checks out, he could become a practice-squad penny stock with a chance to pay off down the road when fully healthy.",5.40
NA,NA
Tall receiver with marginal deep speed but a plus ability to challenge for the deep ball and come down with it thanks to his long arms and body control. He doesn’t have the quickness or route running to free himself underneath so he needs to find an offense that allows him to play downfield and win with size.,5.40
NA,NA
NA,NA
Lacks the athleticism to play outside and the strength to be a guard in the NFL.,5.10
NA,NA
"While Brindza was hurt by poor snaps on a couple of his misses, he simply had a down year for accuracy. His ability to hit kickoffs with some force as well as be a serviceable emergency punter could help his cause.",5.10
NA,NA
Interesting pass-catcher out of the backfield with more agility and ability after the catch than expected. Burton lacks functional size and run-blocking acumen necessary to be a full-time fullback in a zone-scheme offense and will have to prove to be invaluable as a special-teams player in order to warrant a roster spot as an H-back.,5.10
NA,NA
"Clark has mid-round talent, but his arrest and prior indiscretions make it unlikely that teams will be willing to draft him. If he gets everything sorted out, he has a shot at getting into a camp.",5.10
"JUCO transfer considered to be a player with personal and football character issues by those in the know. Rumor has it some teams are considering Clear for a conversion to tackle, but the tape doesn't present a player who is physical enough to handle that switch. With almost no production to fall back on, Clear's best shot could be as a camp invite.",5.10

"Stiff, limited tackle-only prospect lacking the core strength and leverage to play inside.",5.10
NA,NA
Average size and athleticism with no physical or explosive traits showing up on tape to hang his hat on.,5.10
NA,NA
"Davis is a big, reliable target who simply falls well below the NFL standard for functional play speed at the wide receiver position. Maybe he will surprise at his workouts, but the tape doesn't show a player who can get much separation with necessary athleticism. He might not be strong enough to handle it, but additional weight on his frame could make him a candidate for a shot as a move tight end.",5.10
NA,NA
"His overall length will be intriguing for some NFL teams. He seems to lack the power to move defenders in the run game and his feet are very average as a pass protector. The talent doesn't appear to be draftable, but the length might be enough to get a bite.",5.10
NA,NA
Not instinctive or athletic. Can't hang his hat on coverage ability or run-stuffing acumen. He's an inside linebacker with limited range who must prove he can be a special-teams monster to make it.,5.10
NA,NA
"Isn't able to latch onto targets, which hinders his consistency as a run blocker in power. Foot quickness is a weakness, which creates too much lunging and leaning in his game. Feliciano is a competent college guard who appears to be lacking the athleticism and technique to be a full-time NFL starter.",5.10
NA,NA
"Solid accuracy and has clutch kicks under his belt, but inability to boom kickoffs will make a trip into camp via undrafted free agency the very likely scenario.",5.10
NA,NA
"Strange combination of lateral quickness and noticeable stiffness in lower half in pass sets and in space. Gibson has the movement skills of a zone tackle, but NFL teams might look right past him on draft day if he doesn't add more functional core strength.",5.10
NA,NA
"Hatchie has some good football qualities, but he doesn't have tackle qualities. He has enough quickness to move inside to guard for zone-scheme teams, but might still lack the necessary power. Center might be his best bet at the next level.",5.10
Lacks elusiveness and doesn't carry enough power behind his pads to create any intrigue. Couldn't even get to 100 carries in a single season while in college and unlikely to be able to break into rotation in the pros.,5.10
NA,NA
"One-speed running back with some weight behind his pads, but not enough explosive power to offset his lack of burst and overall athleticism. Could struggle to find a home as an NFL running back and might need to take a look at playing fullback.",5.10
NA,NA
Long-shot project with tremendous height and good athleticism. He might possess the necessary athletic traits worthy of a camp invite.,5.10
NA,NA
"Power in his leg is nothing special and his hang-time leaves much to be desired, but he offers depth thanks to his versatility and he’s a quality ball-striker.",5.10
NA,NA
"Despite being a three-year starter for the Hurricanes, there are certain core traits that a player must have to make an NFL roster and McDermott's lack of strength and athleticism could limit his opportunities.",5.10

"One-year starter in the SEC with adequate size. Poor footwork and substantial accuracy and ball placement issues have him tabbed as a draft reject on several draft boards, according to scouts.",5.10

Limited tight end who was primarily used as a blocker in college. Tomlinson will have to prove to teams that he has premium ability to develop as an in-line blocker because it is unlikely that most teams will view him as a combo tight end once they study the tape.,5.10
NA,NA
"His combine speed will have people talking, as will his size and the classroom efforts that have helped him earn Academic All-Big 12 honors for four straight years. Unfortunately, his lack of cover talent, physicality and ball skills could make it tough for him to get much of a look from pro teams.",5.10

"One of the most versatile players in college football the past three seasons, Jack earned a reputation as a dynamic defender and a contributor on offense. In fact, he earned both the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year award in 2013, as well as being named finalist for Paul Hornung Award as the nation’s most versatile player.  A second-team All-Pac 12 defender as a freshman (75 tackles, two interception, 11 passes defended), he had seven rushing touchdowns on the year as well. Pac-12 coaches voted him second team all-conference again in 2014, as he made 88 tackles, eight for loss, intercepted one pass and broke up seven others. He also contributed as a runner, as well, carrying the rock 28 times for 113 yards and three scores. Jack’s junior year was stopped short by a knee injury three games in, though he looked like he was on the way to a fantastic season before the malady occurred (15 tackles, interception). Despite the injury, Jack announced he had ""done enough"" at UCLA and wanted to be compensated for his play -- so he declared for early entry in the 2016 NFL Draft. Considering that his mother insured Jack against injury after his freshman season, it's not surprising that economics won the day in Jack's decision.",7.50
"The 2015 season was difficult for Tunsil. First, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in Ole Miss' loss to TCU in the 2014 Peach Bowl. Tunsil then was charged with domestic assault against his stepfather in June, reportedly for sticking up for his mother. Those charges were eventually dismissed, but then the NCAA brought another piece of bad news soon after, suspending Tunsil for seven games due to impermissible benefits he received (vehicle loans without payment, free airline ticket and rental car) and failing to be forthcoming with investigators. When he was on the field, though, Tunsil lived up to his billing as the No. 1 high school recruit at offensive tackle. He started nine games at left tackle as a true freshman, earning second-team All-SEC notice from league media and various Freshman All-American honors. Tunsil missed two games with a partially torn bicep in 2014, but started the rest, garnering first-team All-SEC nod from the Associated Press (second team from coaches) and All-American recognition from multiple media outlets. He didn’t make many post-season all-conference lists in his shortened junior season (starting six games at left tackle), but finished his career in a way most offensive linemen can only dream of -- running in a two-yard touchdown on a throw-back pass behind the line of scrimmage in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State.",7.50
"It would be foolish for team to be wary of selecting Buckner because of the lack of success of former Ducks defender and number three overall pick Dion Jordan, as he's a completely different type of player. The 2015 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, Ted Hendricks Award finalist and member of multiple All-American squads (first team USA Today, second team AP, etc.) presents a thicker frame, portending an NFL career with his hand on the ground, rather than a stand-up pass rusher like Jordan. Buckner had become a name to note as a 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 pick (led team with 13 tackles for loss) after two seasons as a partial-year starter; he had 29 tackles and two starts, playing in every game as a true freshman in 2013, followed by a eight-start sophomore season (3.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks). He finished off his career in style (83 tackles, 17 for loss, Pac-12 leading 10.5 sacks), putting himself among the top prospects in the senior class.",7.40
"Elliott's dad, Stacy, played linebacker for the Missouri Tigers and was on the unfortunate end of the infamous ""fifth down"" play in which Colorado scored a game-winning touchdown (which might not have crossed the goal line) after officials in charge of the down markers failed to mark a play. ""Zeke"" has had much more success than heartbreak during his athletic career, however. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch High School Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, Elliott also had the speed to win four state titles in track and field (100 meters, 200 meters, 110 high hurdles, and 300 hurdles).  He contributed as a reserve in his freshman year in Columbus (30-262, two TD rushing) before hitting it big in 2014, finishing with three straight 200-yard games, including two against Alabama which (scoring six times in those two contests) helped the Buckeyes win the national title. Elliott carried forth the momentum from the end of his honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year into 2015, when he received the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award (1,821 yards, 23 TD rushing; 27-206 receiving) and second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and USA Today. Unfortunately, Ohio State's home loss to Michigan State on a terrible weather day, in which Elliott received only 15 carries (complaining to the media afterwards about his lack of totes), prevented the team from defending its title in the College Football Playoff. His 149-yard, four touchdown effort against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl put a happy ending on his career, however, allowing him to finish second all-time in rushing yards for the storied Buckeyes program.",7.30
"Heading into the Fiesta Bowl, Smith was considered one of the best defenders in the country and a sure-fire elite prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft. He tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee during the team’s loss to Ohio State, however, placing some doubt on whether he would apply for early entry. The 2015 consensus All-American decided he had done enough in his college career, however, deciding to put his name in the hat despite the intense rehabilitation ahead of him. Smith became the second player to win both the high school and college Butkus Awards as the nation’s top linebacker, joining former Notre Dame star Manti Te'o, by leading the Irish with 113 tackles, nine of which went for losses. It was the second straight season Smith topped the defensive stats chart in tackles (112) and made nine TFLs. In his first year on campus, Smith started all 13 games, making 67 stops, 6.5 for loss. It is expected that Smith will bounce back from his knee surgery to become the athletic, explosive defender that wowed scouts over the past three years.",7.30
"Bosa plans to follow in the footsteps of his father and uncle as NFL first-round picks; John Bosa was picked 16th overall by Miami in 1987 coming out of Boston College, while Eric Kumerow was picked in the same spot, again by the Dolphins, the following year. Joey Bosa's own potential as an elite prospect has been clear since arriving in Columbus, as he made his way into the starting lineup 10 times as a true freshman (13.5 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks) to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten honors. As a sophomore, he captured unanimous All-American honors, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year award (led the conference with 21 tackles for loss, 13.5 sacks) and was named a finalist for three national awards as the nation’s top defender: the Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy, and Ted Hendricks Award. His junior year got off to a slow start, however, as he was suspended for the opener for violating team rules. Statistically, his 2015 season was not as impressive as the year before (16 tackles for loss, five sacks) but Big Ten coaches still named him the conference’s Defensive Lineman of the Year because of his rare combination of strength against the run and consistent presence in the backfield.",7.00
"It’s tough not to think of former Georgia star linebacker Boss Bailey when watching Floyd, a long, lean pass rusher. An all-state pick in his Georgia high school days, Floyd played a year at Hargrave Military Academy before heading to Athens (as many Georgia recruits do).  He started eight of 13 games played in 2013, receiving All-Freshman SEC notice after making 9.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks. Floyd was awarded the Bulldogs' Defensive MVP in 2014 (though he missed the team's bowl game having knee surgery) to go along with honorable mention all-conference honors from league media (8.5 tackles for loss, six sacks). In his final year between the hedges, Floyd led the Bulldogs in sacks for the third straight year (4.5) and tied for the team lead with 10.5 tackles for loss, garnering second-team All-SEC notice from league coaches. The 2015 Butkus Award finalist is no joke off the edge, as many college tackles would confirm.",7.00
"Instead of following the path of his father, Jerry, to major league baseball (played catcher for three teams over six seasons), Goff starred as a high school quarterback in the Bay Area. Cal coaches put him right into the fire in 2013, and he answered the challenge as the school's first-ever freshman opening weekend starting quarterback. The honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick (18 TD, 10 INT) set school records for passing yards (3,508), passes completed (320), and passes attempted (531) on a 1-11 team lacking great talent. He suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder in the ""Big Game"" against Stanford that year, but managed to return for the 2014 spring game.  In fact, he started all 12 games as a sophomore, completing 62.1 percent of his passes for 3,973 yards and 35 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. Goff capped his career at Cal with a first team All-Pac-12 season, starting every game and setting conference records with 4,719 passing yards and 43 touchdowns on the year. The Bears also won their first bowl game since 2008 when Goff threw for 467 yards and six touchdowns when they took out Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. Even before that victory, however, Goff decided to move on to the professional ranks after the season as one of the top quarterback prospects for the 2016 NFL Draft.",7.00
"Hargreaves carries the football genes of his father, Vernon II, who was on UConn's 100th anniversary's team and has coached linebackers and special teams for multiple schools (USF, Houston, Arkansas). He was the National Defensive Player of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus as a senior high school, a finalist for the Florida Mr. Football award, and the Most Valuable Player of the Under Armour All-American game. So it was no surprise that he worked his way on the field as a true freshman, ranking among the leaders in the SEC with 14 passes defended, including three interceptions. Hargreaves not only earned first-team All-SEC honors in all three of his seasons in Gainesville, but also lined up multiple All-American honors in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass breakups) and 2015 (four interceptions, four pass break-ups) due to his playmaking ability.",7.00
"Three years ago, the Razorbacks were delighted to have a legacy recruit in their backyard (Little Rock), who just happened to be one of the top tight end prospects in the country. His father, Mark, played offensive tackle for Arkansas from 1988 to 1991, serving as a team captain his senior year. Hunter didn't make it to his senior year, however, choosing to enter the 2016 NFL Draft after a spectacular junior season where he won the John Mackey Award as the nation’s top tight end and garnered consensus first team All-American honors. The first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches and media had 51 catches for 739 yards and three scores on the year. This production wasn’t out of the blue, given his recruiting status and production as a sophomore (37-513, two touchdowns receiving) and a true freshman in 2013 (28-409, four scores despite fighting issues in both knees).",7.00
"The question heading into Ragland’s senior season wasn’t whether he would be a solid run-stuffer as a starting 3-4 inside linebacker in the NFL, as his play the past two falls secured that notion. He earned his spot as an elite prospect, though, with his play in 2015. He led the Tide with 97 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and broke up six passes, winning SEC Defensive Player of the Year, numerous All-American honors and landing finalist spots for multiple national awards. In fact, Ragland was the third Alabama player to earn unanimous All-American notice, joining Cornelius Bennett and Derrick Thomas. Ragland could have left for the NFL last year, but decided to come back to win a championship, get his degree, and continue his work in the community.",7.00
"Ramsey was a top-rated recruit (No. 10 overall by Rivals) out of Tennessee, stepping right into the fire in Tallahassee. In fact, he was the first freshman to start the opener at cornerback for the Seminoles since Deion Sanders 30 years earlier. Each year with FSU, he's garnered several honors, from Freshman All-American nod in 2013 () to All-American and first-team All-ACC accolades in both 2014 (79 tackles, 9.5 for loss, two interceptions, 12 pass break-ups) and 2015 (3.5 tackles for loss, 10 pass break-ups). Ramsey is not in Sanders’ class as an athlete (though not many are), but he did win ACC indoor and outdoor long jump titles in 2015. And he has shown great versatility throughout his career, splitting time between cornerback and safety his freshman year, playing the Spur spot in 2014, before moving back to corner as a junior.",7.00
"Nick Saban has made a habit of creating NFL defensive lineman during his time in Tuscaloosa, recruiting the best of the best from the high school ranks and making the most of their potential. Robinson was another one of those five-star recruits who came in ready to contribute. He played all 13 games (starting two) as a true freshman, making 38 stops, eight for loss, and leading the Tide with 5.5 sacks. Robinson displayed versatility by playing inside and outside as a sophomore, earning honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media as a full-time starter (6.5 tackles for loss) by splitting his time between the nose tackle and five-technique spots. He first gained the true attention of scouts that season when racking up nine tackles, three for loss, against Missouri in the SEC Championship Game. Robinson's career reached its apex in 2015, as he garnered consensus All-American honors and was named a finalist for the Outland Trophy.  He was one of the main cogs of the nation’s third-rated defense, making 46 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 15 games as the Tide won the national title.",7.00
"Stanley had a chance to leave for the National Football League after his third year in South Bend, but decided to return after watching Ohio State win the national championship in January of 2015. He wanted to be part of a national championship contender. Although that didn’t quite happen (Notre Dame lost games to conference champions Clemson and Stanford, each by two points before losing to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl), Stanley didn't hurt his draft stock with a 2015 second-team All-American season at left tackle. NFL scouts had hoped he would come out the year before, as he looked like a future pro while starting all 13 games at left tackle as the Irish's Offensive Lineman of the Year in 2014. Stanley started every game at the right tackle as a redshirt freshman (he played two early season games as a reserve in 2012), showing great promise. A durable, intelligent player with experience at both tackle spots, Stanley will be a coveted prospect.",7.00
"Billings was already a big name around Waco before he even agreed to play for the Bears, dominating on the high school football field (266 pancake blocks in his junior and senior years) and setting a state record in power-lifting with 2,010 total pounds at the state meet (805 squat, 705 dead lift, 500 on bench).  Despite the high expectations, he somehow lived up to his billing. After contributing as a true freshman (two starts, 29 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss), Billings came into his own in 2014, receiving consensus first-team All-Big 12 notice with 37 tackles, 11.5 for loss.  The league named him co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2015, leading Baylor with 15 tackles for loss and tying for the team lead with 5.5 sacks as he heard his name mentioned on several All-American squads. The fact he led the Bears in tackles for loss and sacks shows the athleticism and aggressive nature of his game.",6.80
"In hindsight, it's difficult to comprehend that Conklin had zero scholarship offers from FBS-level colleges coming out of high school. The son of a high school football coach, Conklin had all of the tools to start with, which may have been why Michigan State came through with a preferred walk-on offer in the spring of 2012. He earned a scholarship halfway through his redshirt season, working over highly-recruited defensive ends in practice to earn their respect.  Conklin started 13 of 14 games in 2013, 10 at left tackle and three on the right side, to earn multiple Freshman All-American honors. More people started taking notice of his toughness and strength in his sophomore season, as both league coaches and media named him a second-team Big Ten player at left tackle. Even though Conklin missed two games in his junior campaign with a leg injury, he garnered All-American recognition from nearly every outlet in addition to consensus first-team All-Big Ten honors for his ability to protect quarterback Connor Cook. Conklin's leadership and skills on the line during his final year in East Lansing helped the Spartans climb the Ohio State hump and capture a much-desired Big Ten Championship.",6.80
"Dodd was not as highly-touted as fellow defensive end Shaq Lawson coming into the 2015 season, but by the end of the year he was just as respected. The South Carolina native went to Hargrave Military Academy for the 2011 season before arriving in Clemson, and spent three years as a reserve (six tackles in eight games in 2012, seven tackles in four games in 2013, eight tackles, 2.5 for loss in 12 games in 2014) behind the Tigers’ ever-talented defensive line before getting into the starting line-up on the strong side across from Lawson. Dodd's ascension was set back a bit by a knee injury in the 2013 season, but his play the following fall portended an excellent redshirt junior year. Dodd finished just behind his All-American teammate in tackles for loss (23.5) and sacks (12), receiving honorable mention all-conference notice from ACC coaches for his efforts. Those coaches might have voted him first team after the national championship game, however, as he lit up the Crimson Tide with five tackles for loss, including three sacks.",6.80
"Lynch was lost a bit in the recruiting process after sitting out half of his senior season due to a knee injury suffered in the preseason, allowing Memphis head coach Justin Fuente to nab the Florida product from the under the noses of in-state schools. He redshirted his first year on campus, but then stepped in to become a three-year starter for Fuente. Lynch went through some ups and downs in his first year as a starter, throwing nine touchdowns against 10 interceptions and completing just 58 percent of his passes for about 2,000 yards in 2013. He improved greatly as a sophomore, leading his team to a 10-win season and American Athletic Conference championship. He received second team All-AAC honors that season by completing 63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards and 22 scores.  Lynch exploded onto the national scene during his junior year, garnering a Manning Award finalist nod, first team All-ACC honors, and team MVP after leading the Tigers to an 8-0 start before the team struggled down the stretch losing to Navy, Houston, and Temple. During the team’s hot streak, Lynch beat SEC foe Ole Miss with a 39-for-53, 386-yard, three-touchdown performance. But the next time he faced a SEC defense, Auburn took him to task in the Birmingham Bowl, forcing him to complete just 16 of 37 pass attempts for a measly 106 yards and an interception. Despite finishing the season on a down note, the departure of Fuente for Virginia Tech and positive accolades received from the NFL scouting community led Lynch to take his talents to the next level.",6.80
"Nkemdiche (kim-DEECH-ee) presented elite athleticism and quick-twitch movement as the top defensive end prospect in the country coming into Oxford as part of the 2013 recruiting class. He's one of the more interesting prospects in the 2016 draft class, as well, because Georgia native never really had great statistical production despite his manifold pro-ready characteristics. He started 10 games for the Rebels in 2013, garnering Freshman All-American and Freshman All-SEC notice with eight tackles for loss and two sacks on the year. In Nkemdiche's sophomore year, he received second-team All-American honors from several media outlets despite making just four tackles for loss and two sacks in 13 starts. His junior year realized similar results, again being named second team All-American with statistics half as impressive as most others named to the team (seven TFL, three sacks). Nkemdiche's career at Ole Miss ended on a sour note, however, as he was arrested for marijuana possession after taking a fall from an Atlanta area hotel room. He was suspended from the team's bowl game after the incident, and decided to leave for the National Football League.",6.80
"Another one of Ole Miss' great recruiting pickups over the past few years, Treadwell was a five-star recruit, consensus All-American, and overall No. 1 receiver prospect in the country. Not surprisingly, he parlayed his talent to selection as the top freshman in the SEC in 2013 (72-608, five scores). Things were going swimmingly for Treadwell as a sophomore until he suffered a broken fibula against Auburn in the last month of the season; he finished with 48 catches for 632 yards and five touchdowns in nine games.  Despite the late-season injury, he worked hard (losing 25 pounds without any strength) to play in the 2015 season opener and helped the Rebels beat Alabama in mid-September (5-80, TD). Treadwell only got better as he gained confidence in his surgically-repaired leg, finishing the year with 82 catches, 1,153 yards, and 11 scores as a Biletnikoff Award finalist, All-American (second team Walter Camp, third team AP), and first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches. The icing on the cake for Treadwell was his performance in his final game for Ole Miss, catching three touchdowns against Oklahoma State in the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory.",6.80
"As the Wildcats' strongest and most athletic lineman, Whitehair (6-4, 309) has been moved from right tackle to left guard, back to right tackle, and finally to left tackle for his last two seasons. His play on the blind side earned him first-team All-Big 12 honors in 2015 (following two second-team nods and an honorable mention as a freshman), as he not only possesses the footwork to hold off edge rushers but understands the angles needed to free space for running backs. His versatility and technique make him among the top linemen in the draft class.",6.80
"One of the most highly sought-after recruits in Clemson history, Alexander was ranked the fourth-best prospect in the country by ESPN coming out of high school. His work ethic and football acumen would have gotten him on the field as a true freshman in 2013 season, but he redshirted instead with a groin injury. Once Alexander got on the field, opponents found out why he was rated so highly. In 2014, he was named Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-ACC honors as a full-time starter. As a redshirt sophomore, he earned third-team All-American and first-team all-conference notice for locking down receivers. In fact, his lack of statistical production over the past two years (no interceptions, 11 pass breakups in 2014-2015) shows how little opponents challenged him.",6.70
"The Gators have had a versatile defensive lineman selected in the first round in two of the last three drafts: Sharrif Floyd to Minnesota in 2013 and Dominique Easley by the Patriots in 2014. Bullard is looking to become the next in line. The former five-star recruit has moved between end and tackle during his career, showing off both quickness and power. He was fairly productive despite playing inside often as a junior (8.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks), but really turned on the juice as a senior (66 tackles, 17.5 TFL, 6.5 sacks), earning third team All-American honors from the Associated Press as well as consensus first team All-SEC honors.",6.70
"A big body in the middle of the Bulldogs' defense, Butler proved in his two years as a starter that he has the girth and nimble feet to clog up running lanes. Conference USA coaches rectified their error in not giving Butler all-conference recognition in 2014 (56 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss) by voting him first-team All-C-USA after his senior year (50 tackles, 10 TFL, three sacks, eight quarterback hurries). NFL teams will not miss the opportunity to add Butler to their interior.",6.70
"Clark started 51 straight games for the Red Raiders, spending his final three years at left tackle and his freshman season at right guard. All three years at left tackle, he earned All-Big 12 honors, and as a senior he was named a second-team All-American for his efforts. It's unclear where Clark's best position will be at the next level; he flashes the lateral agility and recovery speed to play on the edge against college pass rushers, so he should get a shot at left tackle. It’s possible, though, that Clark might be best inside where he can lock on and create creases for the running game. His durability, pro-ready body (6-6, 313), and next-level tenacity make him a likely NFL starter wherever he lines up.",6.70
"Coleman grew up in a tough Dallas neighborhood playing football in the streets, with a father who is currently serving prison time for felony cocaine distribution. But with the guidance and hard work of his mother, Cassandra Jones, as well as his godfather, former Baylor and NFL star defensive back Ray Crockett, Coleman fulfilled his potential as a playmaker at the college level. As a redshirt freshman, Coleman started 10 games in head coach Art Briles' offense, catching 35 passes for 527 yards and two scores, as well as averaging over 28 yards per kickoff return. His sophomore season started late, as he missed the first three games of the year with a hamstring injury, but finished strong. He was named second-team All-Big 12 (first team by the media) after covering 1,119 yards and scoring 11 times on just 64 receptions. Most importantly, Coleman came up big at the right times (15-224, TD vs Oklahoma, 7-150, TD vs Michigan in Cotton Bowl) ... but that was just a hint of things to come.  Coleman won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s top receiver in 2015, along with unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference honors, leading the country with 20 touchdown receptions (74-1,363 receiving for the year). He missed the team's Russell Athletic Bowl win over North Carolina after having sports hernia surgery in December in order to be ready for the run up to the 2016 NFL Draft.",6.70
"Cravens' extended family has several NFL ties, including cousin Jordan Cameron (former USC and current Miami Dolphins tight end), distant cousin Manti Te'o (Notre Dame/San Diego Chargers linebacker) and his mother's second cousin David Fulcher (former Arizona State and Cincinnati Bengals safety). While those genes portend great athleticism, Cravens made his own name as the USA Today National High School Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 (97 tackles, eight sacks, three INT). He graduated from Vista Murrieta High a semester early to join USC for 2013, securing a starting spot at strong safety the following fall despite injuring his knee in the spring. Cravens made various Freshman All-American teams as well as honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice (52 tackles, four interceptions). He moved to a safety/linebacker hybrid role as a sophomore (a change he strongly resisted at first), leading the team with 17 tackles for loss (five sacks) and three interceptions to earn third team AP All-American and first-team All-Pac-12 accolades. Cravens repeated those honors in 2015, topping all Trojan defenders with 86 tackles, 15 for loss, and 5.5 sacks and once again showing his overall game by intercepting two passes and breaking up two others.",6.70
"Fuller had a difficult decision on whether to leave Notre Dame early for the National Football League. Like many underclassmen before him, he initially believed he would return to campus, and then upon reflection, decided it was time to move on to the next level. It's hard to fault him after being named the Irish team MVP with 62 receptions for 1,258 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2015. Fuller wasn't a one-year wonder, however, as he had an outstanding sophomore campaign (76-1,094, 15 TD) and showed big-play promise (6-160, one score).  He went to the same high school as Pro Football Hall of Fame candidate Marvin Harrison; Fuller’s lean build and ability to get deep on defenses will earn him comparisons based on their games as well as their upbringing.",6.70
"It's tough to accomplish more as a high school or college athlete than Henry did over the past five years. He won the 2012 Maxwell Club National High School Player of the Year award after setting a national record for career rushing yards (12,124, including 4,261 in his senior season) and scored 153 touchdowns. Then, despite breaking his leg in spring practices after graduating early from Yulee High (Florida), Henry averaged more than 10 yards per carry as a true freshman for the Tide (35-382, 3 TDs) and scored on a 61-yard reception -- his only one of the season. Even though the 6-3, 242-pound back started just two games as a sophomore, Henry consistently shared carries with T.J. Yeldon, covering 990 yards on just 172 totes (5.8 per) and scoring 11 times. He topped off his collegiate career by winning the 2015 Heisman Trophy, along with the Doak Walker, Maxwell, Walter Camp Player of the Year awards. The unanimous first-team All-American led the nation with 2,219 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns last fall, more or less winning the Heisman by racking up 213 yards and three touchdowns against LSU in a showdown with fellow trophy hopeful Leonard Fournette (who had 31 yards for the game). His true ""Heisman moment"" came after he already owned the hardware, as he came up huge in the national championship game win over Clemson, carrying the pail 36 times for 167 yards and three scores.",6.70
"Though Henry had 10 sacks playing for Ted Ginn, Sr. at powerhouse Glenville (Ohio) High, he was not highly regarded in recruiting circles. Each year we played for the Wolverines, however, he showed the improvement NFL scouts like to see when evaluating a prospects ""upside.""  In 2013, Henry was a strong contributor, starting six times and making 32 tackles, three for loss. He started six times again the next year, being credited with 20 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three sacks and an interception. Henry began fulfilling his potential during his final year in Ann Arbor, starting nine games and earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors, racking up 34 tackles, 10 for loss, and tying for the team lead with 6.5 sacks. After talking with former high school and college teammate Frank Clark, who was a second-round pick of Seattle in 2015, Henry decided it was time to leave for the NFL.",6.70
"When Alabama-Birmingham decided to shut down its football program before the 2015 season, the Hoosiers found an outstanding player waiting for a new opportunity in Howard. The Alabama native had two very productive years for the Blazers, who stood by him during the recruiting process after he suffered a torn meniscus and a stress fracture in his pelvis during his junior year in high school. Howard earned five starts as a true freshman in 2013 (881 yards, 6.1 yards per rush average, two touchdowns) and then exploded for first-team All-Conference USA honors the next season. He actually set a UAB rushing record with 1,587 yards on a workhorse-level 306 carries in 2014, scoring 13 times. The step up to a Power Five conference didn't faze Howard, as he won over Big Ten coaches for first-team All-Conference honors (1,213 rush yards, 6.2 yards per rush, nine touchdowns; 11 catches, 106 yards, one touchdown receiving). Rushing for 174 yards against a tough Iowa squad, as well as 238 on 35 carries against Michigan, showed he has the talent to succeed at any level.",6.70
"A late-bloomer on a middling high school team, Jones went from unknown prospect to a top 50 prospect nationally during his senior year, leading the squad to their first-ever playoff win. Despite late pressure from other top schools, Jones stayed true to MSU, which is near his home in Houston, Miss. He started three games as a true freshman, receiving honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media after tying for the team lead with seven tackles for loss. Jones had a sophomore slump, however, making just 26 stops, 3.5 for loss, and playing a reserve role the entire season. He rebounded in 2015, starting every game and making 44 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and 2.5 sacks, leading him to take his talents to the NFL as an early entrant.",6.70
"Great things were expected from Lawson, who was the top-rated prep school player in the country out of Hargrave Military Academy after a successful high school career in South Carolina. He played well as a reserve for two seasons behind the ever-stacked Tiger defensive line, racking up double-digit tackles for loss each year (10 in 2013, 11 in 2014). With the departure of the likes of Vic Beasley and Malliciah Goodman, Lawson finally got a chance to start in 2015 and made the most of it, constantly exploding into the backfield to finish among the nation's leaders in tackles for loss (25.5) and sacks (12.5). Lawson's personal accomplishments (consensus All-American, first-team All-ACC) led to great team success, as he and fellow junior Kevin Dodd and sophomore Heisman Trophy candidate Deshaun Watson helped the Tigers to an undefeated regular season, ACC title, and national championship game appearance.",6.70
"Lee's never been short on confidence, proclaiming to teammates that he was the one to take over for 2014 first-round pick Ryan Shazier in the Buckeyes' defense -- even though he was only a year removed from starring as a quarterback and cornerback in high school. He wound up starting all 15 games in that redshirt freshman year for the national champion Buckeyes, earning multiple Freshman All-American accolades with 81 tackles, 16.5 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks. Lee truly hit the national stage by terrorizing Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, receiving Defensive MVP honors with seven tackles, three for loss, and two sacks. His play as a sophomore was just as good, tracking down ball carriers 66 times, 11 for a loss and 4.5 sacks on his way to second-team All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches (third team media).",6.70
"Ogbah's family moved from Nigeria to the Houston when he was nine years old, with the hopes of finding a better way of life. The child given the middle name Ikechukwu (which means ""God's power"") flourished athletically in his new country, eventually becoming a finalist for the greater Houston high school defensive player of the year. He chose Oklahoma State partially due to his appreciation of former OSU offensive tackle Russell Okung, a fellow native of Nigeria who had great success with the Cowboys and in the NFL. Ogbah (AWG-buh) played in every game as a redshirt freshman, tying for the team lead with four sacks. Once inserted into the starting lineup, Ogbah starred, winning the Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year with 17 tackles for loss including 11 sacks.  He played well again as a junior (17.5 tackles for loss, conference-high 13 sacks), earning Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year this time around, as well as All-American honors from USA Today, the Walter Camp Foundation, and others. The Ted Hendricks Award finalist couldn’t break through against Ole Miss tackles Laremy Tunsil and Fahn Cooper in the team's Sugar Bowl loss, but NFL scouts still see his potential as a top pass rusher at the next level.",6.70
"In the Cardinals' three-man front, Rankins presents issues for both interior and outside blockers. His only start as a sophomore was in the team's bowl game, but he came on strong as a junior in the team's first year in the ACC (13.5 tackles for loss, eight sacks, two interceptions). ACC coaches elevated him from a third-team all-conference pick to second team this year (13 tackles for loss, six sacks) as he continued to terrorize ballcarriers. Rankins' versatility as a potential starting five-technique or three-technique makes him a fit in any system.",6.70
"The East Mississippi Community College transfer didn’t light up the stat sheet in 2014 (6.5 tackles for loss, one sack in 2014) but looked to be an ascending talent. Though his numbers weren’t much different this year (56 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one sacks), SEC media named him second-team All-SEC because of his utterly disruptive play whether playing between the guards or heads-up on a tackle in the Tide’s feared front line. Reed was arrested for DUI in the summer of 2014, but should overcome any character concerns to become a starter at the next level.",6.70
"Ridgeway moved from California to Texas when he was 14 and, given the fervor that the Lone Star State tackle has for the gridiron, he found himself suiting up for Friday Night Lights not playing up to that point in his life. It didn't take long for his athleticism to shine, as he earned all-state honors and became a coveted recruit who stayed in-state. Ridgeway redshirted in 2012, then played 12 games as a reserve the following year (13 tackles, one for loss).  He started getting after it as a sophomore, starting the final 10 games, making 43 stops and ranking among the team leaders in tackles for loss (11) and sacks (six). Ridgeway lost some time to injuries last fall, starting eight of the 11 games in which he played. He still received honorable mention All-Big 12 notice, however, with 36 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks.",6.70
"Spence's talent is unquestioned, but his judgement off the field will be foremost on the minds of NFL scouts as they evaluate him for the 2016 draft.  A first-team All-Big Ten pick for Ohio State in 2013 as a sophomore, Spence ran into trouble for failing two drug tests. After being permanently banned from the Big Ten for the failed test, he underwent treatment for an addiction to Ecstasy. Instead of leaving for the 2015 draft, Spence decided to transfer to Eastern Kentucky to get his degree and to prove to himself and scouts that he had matured. It appears he made the right choice, racking up 22.5 tackles for loss, with 13.5 sacks for the Colonels to become a AP FCS All-American. At his size, Spence could play end or linebacker in the NFL, giving him a chance to succeed wherever he winds up -- if his life off the field is in order.",6.70
"In his first year as a starter for the Bison in 2014, all Wentz did was throw for 3,111 yards and 25 touchdowns, leading the team to its fourth consecutive FCS Championship. What did the Bismarck, N.D. native do for an encore? Just come back from a broken right wrist that sidelined him for two months to lead NDSU in a fifth-straight title game victory. He started seven games in his senior year, completing 62.5 percent of his passes for 1,651 yards and 17 touchdowns (and four interceptions) while also running for six scores. Intelligence and work ethic are no issues for Wentz, who was named to the College Sports Information Directors Association All-American squad for the second-straight year.",6.70
"Philip ""Scooby"" Wright III (his dad gave him the nickname, calling him his ""little Scooby-Doo"") was simply the best defender in college football in 2014, winning the coveted triple crown of national awards: the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Rotary Lombardi Award and Chuck Bednarik Award. The unanimous All-American and Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year ranked among the top five players in the country with 163 tackles, 29 tackles for loss, 14 sacks and six forced fumbles. He was a one-man wrecking crew. Wright showed some glimpses of that talent in his freshman season, where he started 12 games, making 83 tackles, 9.5 for loss, and an interception straight off the bus as a two-time California All-State pick. His junior year was much more of a struggle than he expected, as he played just three games due first to a torn lateral meniscus in this left knee and then to a sprained right foot. His final game in a Wildcat uniform was one to remember, however, as he racked up 15 stops, 3.5 for loss and two sacks against an option team in the New Mexico Lobos in the New Mexico Bowl. Wright was a two-star recruit despite his successful high school career due to a perceived lack of athleticism, but doubters of his ability to play in the NFL have hopefully learned their lesson.",6.70
"Despite experiencing uneven quarterback play during his time at Pitt, Boyd became the most prolific pass-receiver in the school’s history, setting records for receptions (254 in three years) and receiving yards (3,361). Boyd grew up not far from Pittsburgh, and stood out even in a football-crazy state like Pennsylvania, setting the state record with 117 career touchdowns and winning the Class A Player of the Year twice. As a freshman, Boyd didn’t disappoint, garnering third-team All-ACC honors with 85 catches covering 1,174 yards and seven scores. He also ran for 108 yards and earned 425 kick return yards for the season, as well as returning a punt 54 yards for a score in the team’s bowl game.  Boyd received first team all-conference nods as a receiver in his sophomore (78-1,261, eight TD receiving) and junior (91-926, six TD receiving, 349 rush yards), while collecting second-team All-ACC honors as a returner in 2014 (442 kick return yards, 162 punt return yards). With all of that production in just three seasons, it was no surprise Boyd entered the 2016 NFL Draft.",6.40
"A stand-up rush linebacker with length and agility, Fackrell came out the box strong for the Aggies, garnering all-conference honors in each of his first two seasons on campus (21 tackles for loss, eight sacks in 2012-2013). Fackrell suffered a torn ACL in the season opener as a junior but returned with in his final year, consistently making plays on the edge against the run (82 tackles) and attacking the backfield (15 tackles for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles, five recovered). Scouts appreciate the maturity of a plyer who has gone through injury adversity, as well as taken on responsibilities via marriage and fatherhood. Fackrell and his wife, Elizabeth, welcomed a baby girl (Delaney) into the word early in 2015.",6.40
"Jenkins, Georgia's Most Improved Player for the 2014 season (9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks), came out in a flash as a senior, racking up 11 tackles, 5.5 for loss and two sacks against Vanderbilt. Groin and hip injuries limited him throughout the year, however (59 tackles, 10.5 for loss, four sacks), keeping him off all-conference teams. Jenkins started six games as a true freshman(eight tackles for loss, five sacks) and earned second-team All-SEC honors as a sophomore (12 tackles for loss, five sacks) before truly coming into his own as a junior.",6.40
"Johnson is one of two Big Ten performers in his own family, as his sister, Kennedy, plays on the hardwood for Michigan State. He was an all-state performer in basketball during high school, and Cap-Atlantic Player of the Year as a senior, but as his 6-4, 325-pound frame continued to fill out, it was clear he belonged on the football field. Johnson sat out a redshirt season in 2012, then ate up room inside the next year, starting two games, making 27 tackles, two for a loss. In an honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore season, Johnson saved his best for last, racking up seven of his 49 tackles (six for loss) for the year in a Pinstripe Bowl win over Boston College. Somehow while earning all-conference honors (third team from coaches, second team from media) in 2015, Johnson managed to earn his journalism degree with the hopes of joining a broadcast crew once his NFL career is over -– which might be a while given the size and athleticism he showed while accumulating 78 tackles, 15 for loss, and six sacks last season.",6.40
"Undersized for an inside 'backer (a potential factor in the lack of interest by major programs in his home state of Oklahoma), Brothers recognizes plays quickly, works his way through traffic, and flows down the line very effectively as a run-stopper. His junior year was impressive (122 total tackles as a second-team All-SEC pick in 2014), but leading the nation in tackles per game (12.7, 152 total), making more plays in the backfield (12 tackles for loss) and proving himself able to make plays against the pass (two interceptions) and on special teams (three blocked kicks) made him an easy second-team All-American pick by the Associated Press and USA Today for 2015.",6.30
"Kenny Clark, Sr., went to prison in 2005, leaving 9-year-old Kenny, Jr. to mature faster than most of the boys his age. With the help of his mother and others, Clark maintained a good relationship with this father and turned the adversity into a positive, working hard to become an excellent high school player. He started four games as a freshman in 2013 (31 tackles, four for loss, one sack), then stayed a fixture in the lineup the following year. The 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 selection (58 tackles, 5.5 for loss) graduated to all-conference first team as a junior, using his strength and agility to finish second on the Bruins in tackles (75), tackles for loss (11) and sacks (six) despite lining up in the interior. Clark also showed a knack for batting down passes, breaking up five on the year.",6.30
"Many prospects in this draft class have faced adversity, but few have looked cancer in the eye and beaten it. In the spring of 2010, Coleman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the next two-plus years, the top 10 offensive tackle national recruit worked at St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital (located in his hometown of Memphis) to treat and defeat the disease. Coleman was finally cleared to play in the spring of 2012 and redshirted in the fall to get back into football shape. The following year he completed the comeback by playing six games as the backup to 2014 NFL Draft No. 2 overall selection Greg Robinson at left tackle. The past two seasons, Coleman has held down the blind side spot, starting every game and receiving second team All-SEC honors from league coaches. Casual college football fans and NFL scouts alike can see his frame and excellent length and agility, but should be more impressed by the mental toughness he’s shown over the past few years.",6.30
"Cook was the most intriguing senior quarterback prospect heading into the 2015 season, and he did not disappoint in his final campaign. He had already secured a place among the best quarterbacks in MSU history, throwing for nearly 6,000 yards, and tossing 46 touchdowns versus 14 interceptions in his sophomore and junior years -- garnering second team All-Big Ten honors both seasons. In 2015, he captured the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award, leading the Spartans to a spot in the College Football Playoff by throwing for 3,131 yards and 24 touchdowns (throwing seven picks). Cook completed just 56 percent of his passes as a senior, however, down from 58.7 percent and 58.1 percent the previous two years.  The Ohio native also fought off a shoulder injury, missing the win over Ohio State, but returning to help his team win their second Big Ten championship in three years. Cook won the MVP award in both the 2013 and 2015 Big Ten Championship Games.",6.30
"Ohio State's undisputed leader on the offensive line decided to come back for another year in Columbus instead of applying for entry into the 2015 draft, where he might have been a mid-to-late first-round pick. Decker not only got a chance to win back-to-back national titles during his senior year, but also an opportunity to prove he has the natural bend and elite athleticism (to go along with his obvious length, strength, and toughness) to be a top-five selection. The 2015 Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year played strong as the Buckeyes came up just short of reaching the College Football Playoff.",6.30
"Doctson started his collegiate career at Wyoming before transferring back to his home state. He became Heisman Trophy candidate Trevone Boykin's favorite target (65 receptions, 1,018 yards, 11 TD) as a junior and ramped up his game even more in 2015, earning consensus first team All-American honors with a school-record 79 catches for 1,337 yards and 14 scores. Doctson only played in 11 games this year, only sparingly in one of those contests, as he suffered a wrist injury when players fell on him after a catch. The 2015 Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist finished second in TCU history in career receptions and yards, and set the record for touchdown receptions, despite starting his career at another school.",6.30
"Garnett, the son of an NFL nose tackle (Scott Garnett), played in the shadow of other NFL-ready Stanford linemen like 2015 first-round pick Andrus Peat before his senior year. He emerged from that shadow this fall, however, winning numerous All-American honors and the Outland Trophy as the nation’s top interior lineman. His combination of size (6-5, 325) and movement dropped jaws around college football -- especially when he takes an occasional turn as an H-back. Add intelligence and a nasty streak, and Garnett’s got everything an offensive line coach would want to be part of his group.",6.30
"Ifedi's build screams ""NFL offensive lineman."" He's started the past three seasons for the Aggies, starting out as a Freshman All-American right guard blocking for Johnny Manziel the year after the star quarterback won his Heisman Trophy. The following season he moved to right tackle, starting 11 games while missing two due to a sprained MCL. It was hoped that Ifedi could take over the left tackle position in 2015 after the departure of Cedric Ogbuehi to the NFL, but he instead stayed on the right side. Ifedi was named second team All-SEC by league coaches for his work last year. Instead of returning to the Aggies for 2016, he decided to join his brother Martin (who starred as a defensive lineman at Memphis) in the National Football League.",6.30
"Kelly had big shoes to fill when he took over for Rimington Trophy winner Barrett Jones in 2013, but he's handled the pressure quite well. A taller, athletic pivot, Kelly was voted honorable mention All-SEC by league media as a junior, and even won the team's Offensive Player of the Week award twice during the year. He followed that up with a consensus first-team all-conference senior year, leading the way for a Heisman Trophy winner in back Derrick Henry and protecting quarterback Jake Coker on the way to the national title game.",6.30
"Some safeties are content with ""catching"" ball-carriers during their tackle attempts. Neal prefers to make sure those with the ball have nightmares about ""42"" coming their way. The Florida high school all-state pick (151 tackles as a junior) stepped in to tie for the team lead in special teams tackles as a freshman, along with playing a reserve role at safety (five tackles on the year). Neal got the start in eight contests as a sophomore, missing two games with an injury but still managing 45 tackles and racking up three interceptions. He also missed the first two games of the 2015 season with an injured hamstring, but finished with 96 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks, and one interception. Neal joined cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III in leaving for the NFL early after his outstanding junior year.",6.30
"Named as one of the top 15 players in the country coming out of high school, big things were expected from Peake when he arrived at Death Valley. However, injuries and other rising stars (DeAndre Hopkins, Martavis Bryant and Sammy Watkins) held off his explosion on the scene until late in his career. Peake played in 14 games as a true freshman (4-71 receiving, 2-22 kick returns) and started two of 13 games played in a sophomore campaign (25-172, two TD receiving). Peake started the first two games of the 2013 season (8-84, one TD) before tearing his ACL in a September practice. He took a medical redshirt that season, and eventually made his way back onto the field the next season (four starts in seven games, 12-129, two TD receiving). Finally healthy and fully utilized with Deshaun Watson running an excellent Clemson offense that pushed the Tigers to the national championship game, Peake had the best year of his career in 2015 (50-716, five TD).",6.30
"Robinson's talent was never an issue during his time in Baton Rouge, but staying on the field was problematic.  He barely made the deadline for eligibility before his freshman season, but ended up playing in 12 games with two starts (16 tackles, interception, three pass break-ups). In 2014, he was not allowed to dress for the season opener against Wisconsin and started six of eight games played (17 tackles, one pass breakup) before being suspended indefinitely in November. Head coach Les Miles never reinstated Robinson for the 2015 season, so the defender sat out the season instead of transferring to another school. Without hope of re-joining the team in 2016, he entered the NFL draft as an early entrant.",6.30
"Thomas is the nephew of former USC and NFL star receiver Keyshawn Johnson, which portends an excellent pro career. His road to this spot has been bumpy at times, however. Passed over by USC and UCLA as a high school recruit, Thomas went to Fork Union Military Academy (where he roomed with OSU quarterback Cardale Jones) instead of accepting scholarship offers from second-tier programs. He played in 11 games as a freshman, catching just three passes (22 yards) for the Buckeyes, and then was redshirted for the 2013 season just one game in because he was struggling to learn the offense and make his grades. Just one year later, Thomas became the leading receiver (54 catches, 799 yards, nine scores) on a national championship squad. He proved 2014 wasn’t a fluke by once again leading the Buckeyes with 56 catches, 781 yards, and nine touchdowns this fall, garnering third-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches and media. Thomas won't be picked No. 1 overall like his uncle, but an NFL team will see his potential as a Sunday playmaker.",6.30
"Though Apple was highly-recruited out of high school, Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer wasn't sure of what he had during the New Jersey native's first year on campus. But Apple was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that prevented him from giving full effort on the field, in the weight room, and in the classroom. Once that was under control, Meyer and the rest of the coaches saw Apple begin to fulfill his potential. Apple (whose given surname was Woodard, but changed it to honor his stepfather) started 14 of 15 games as a redshirt freshman during Ohio State's run to a national title. In fact, he sealed the Buckeyes' win over Oregon in the championship game, intercepting Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota's final collegiate pass. For the season, he totaled 53 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three interceptions and 10 pass breakups. Although Apple's statistical production decreased in 2015 (33 tackles, two for loss, one interception, eight pass breakups), Big Ten coaches recognized his ability to shut down opposing receivers by voting him second-team all-conference.",6.20
"Bell was a top 30 national recruit out of Georgia, but eschewed the overtures of Alabama and other SEC schools to play for Urban Meyer and the Buckeyes. His faith in Meyer was rewarded with a national championship in 2014, and the fact his team beat Saban's Crimson Tide in the title game was no small irony. Bell got on the field right way for OSU, playing as a reserve at the nickel spot most of his true freshman season before earning a starting spot in the Orange Bowl versus Clemson (seven tackles, interception). He was inserted into one of the safety spots for 14-of-15 contests in the Buckeyes' championship 2014 season, racking up 92 tackles, two for loss, six interceptions and six pass breakups. Though his statistics dropped a bit in his final year in Columbus (65 tackles, two interceptions, nine pass breakups), Bell's play was still impressive enough to receive 2015 second-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches (first team from the media).",6.20
"The former Washington State signee and junior-college star ran just 31 times in his first three games with the Utes in 2014 -- then he ran for an average of 130 yards a game through the rest of the season. Booker followed up that performance with a second-team All-Pac-12 senior campaign (1,261 yards, 11 TD in 10 games) before a torn meniscus sidelined him early. His power, quickness, elusiveness in the hole, and receiving ability (80 receptions in 2014-2015) give him an excitement factor lacking from most collegiate backs.",6.20
"Burns has been as successful a two-sport athlete as any football player has been in the last 20 years. He came to ""The U"" with a pedigree on the football field and the track, earning four-star recruit status while winning a state title in the 110 meter hurdles three times during his high school career (he had the top 110 meter and 300 meter hurdles times in the nation in his junior year). Burns translated that dual success in high school to the Hurricanes, winning All-American and All-Conference honors as a hurdler for the track and field squad and becoming one of the top corners in the ACC. Burns played in a reserve role as a freshman in 2013 (17 tackles, two sacks, three pass breakups) before becoming a starter in his sophomore year (40 tackles, six pass breakups). He flourished in 2015, intercepting six passes (most by a Miami player since Sean Taylor had 10 in 2003) and breaking up five others on his way to consensus second-team All-ACC honors. Unfortunately, Burns also suffered a great loss during his junior year, losing his mother after she suffered a heart attack. Since his father has been incarcerated for some time, the University of Miami started a donation fund to help his family get through the rough period -- they raised $40,000 in six hours. It was not surprising, therefore, that he wanted to declare for the 2016 NFL Draft as an early entrant.",6.20
"Not many players are named to All-American squads once during their college career, much less twice. Calhoun's managed to earn the nod three straight years, making big plays for the Spartans as they competed for Big Ten titles. As a redshirt sophomore, Calhoun was the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year and first team all-conference recognition in addition to second team All-American notice from several sources after recording 14 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks, four fumble recoveries and an interception. The two-time Ted Hendricks Award finalist (2013, 2015) didn’t disappoint in his second year as a starter and first as a team captain, making 39 tackles, 12.5 for loss and eight sacks. Calhoun could have left for the NFL after 2014, but decided to return to compete for a Big Ten title and a national championship. The Spartans did accomplish the former, with the help of Calhoun’s 14.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks before losing to eventual champion Alabama in the College Football Playoff.",6.20
"The Blue Devils are looking for their first back-to-back drafts with a first-round pick in school history, and the former Ohio State Buckeye (he played five games as a true freshman in 2011 before transferring due to the change of coaches) has the sort of all-around game a team may covet enough to use an early pick to secure his services. He's a real presence in the box, as he showed during his sophomore season (121 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, four interceptions) and in another outstanding year in 2014 (111 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks, two picks, seven pass breakups). Cash was recognized as a second-team All-ACC player, as well as receiving second team All-American notice, in both seasons.  In his senior year, Cash joined last year's first-round Blue Devil, guard Laken Tomlinson, as a consensus All-American by amassing 101 tackles, 18 for loss, 2.5 sacks, four pass break-ups, and three forced fumbles.  The Bronco Nagurski and Jim Thorpe Award committees named him a finalist, and ACC coaches named him not only the conference Defensive Player of the Year, but also its top scholar-athlete.  Unfortunately, Cash could not play in the team's bowl game against Indiana, sitting out the Pinstripe Bowl after having surgery on his right wrist.",6.20
"It didn't take long for Collins, one of the most highly recruited high school running backs in the country, to make his mark for the Razorbacks. In fact, he was the first true freshman to start his career with three 100-yard performances since Adrian Peterson in 2004. Even though he shared carries with Jonathan Williams in his first two years on campus, Collins rolled up more than 1,000 yards each year (1,026 with 4 TD in 2013, 1,100 with 12 TD in 2014), joining Darren McFadden as the only Arkansas backs to accomplish that feat. With Williams out with an injury in 2015, Collins's carries increased from 204 in 2014 to 271 in 2015 as did his production (1,577 yards, 20 TD). He earned second team All-SEC honors in his final year, finishing behind Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry (Alabama) and Leonard Fournette (LSU). One of the toughest runners in college football, Collins made the jump to the NFL after his junior year.",6.20
"Many college football players are lacking in discipline, driving their coaches crazy. Cooper does not have that problem, as he grew up in a military family -- his grandfather and father were Marines, and his brother is a Marine. After winning back-to-back state high school titles in North Carolina, Cooper used his maturity to get on the field right away for the Gamecocks, receiving Freshman All-SEC honors as an all-purpose back and returner (359 kick return yards). Once given a chance to receive regular touches on offense, Cooper excelled, garnering consensus first team all-conference recognition as a receiver in 2014 (69-1,136, 11 TD) and second team honors as an all-purpose back (200 rushing yards, two scores). His production dipped a bit in 2015 (66-973, nine TD), but South Carolina's offense struggled in many ways this season. SEC coaches still named him first team all-conference receiver and all-purpose player for his efforts.",6.20
"For a couple of days, Dixon was the leading touchdown scorer in FBS history. Even though Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds bested Dixon’s 87 scores in his final game, Tech’s top dog had an outstanding career. He earned first-team All-Conference USA honors in 2015 (1,070 rush yds, 467 receiving yards, 26 total TD) despite missing two games with an ankle injury. Dixon had earned first-team all-conference notice in the WAC as a true freshman in 2012 (1,194 yards, 27 rush TD) and second-team All-Conference USA the last two years as he hit 1,000 yards rushing (1,299) in 2014 and 917 as a sophomore while fighting a knee injury. That sort of consistency is a rare feat for a college back.",6.20
"NFL scouts don't care one bit about the ethnicity of college football prospects; it's the ultimate color-blind evaluation because either guys can play, have the potential to become players in time, or just don’t have the necessary skill set. Duarte's growing up in a household with Mexican and Japanese influences give him a unique background, but scouting his outstanding skill set as a playmaking receiver is what interests general managers across the league. The four-star wide receiver recruit from successful Mater Dei High School (where his number was retired) jumped into the fray as a true freshman, playing in 13 games with four starts and garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 (16-214, four TD). Duarte was picked as honorable mention all-conference selection again in 2014, leading the conference with an average 19.3 yards per reception from the tight end position (28-540, four TD). Joining forces with freshman phenom quarterback Josh Rosen last season, Duarte became a second-team all-conference pick by catching 10 touchdowns among his 53 catches that covered 872 yards (16.5 per).",6.20
"Stanford has become ""Tight End U"" over the past few years, with former Cardinal contributors Zach Ertz, Levine Tiololo, Coby Fleener and Jim Dray enjoying good NFL careers. Hooper's next in line, leaving for the pros after his redshirt sophomore season. His father actually played at San Diego State, but his uncle, Greg, suited up for Stanford as a fullback from 1979-1982. Those genes were obvious during his two years on the field, first as a redshirt freshman in 2014 where he earned Freshman All-American and second-team All-Pac-12 honors (40-499, two scores). He helped Stanford win a conference championship in his second season, garnering several honors (Mackey Award finalist, third-team AP All-American, first-team All-Pac-12) by catching 34 passes for 438 yards and six touchdowns.",6.20
"Jackson started his career at Trinity Valley Junior College, and found himself a regular starter by the end of his first year with the Cougars in 2013. He stepped up his game as a junior to become a second-team American Athletic Conference pick (two interceptions, 10 pass breakups), ranking among the national leaders in pass breakups before suffering a sprained MCL late in the year. Jackson tweaked a knee during 2015, but started 12 of 13 games, again was named second-team all-conference and finished with five interceptions and 23 pass breakups, leading the nation in passes defended.",6.20
"Ironically, Joseph's play style of a complete lack of respect for his own body was not the reason he missed more than half of his senior season. He injured his knee in a non-contact practice drill, putting a stop to his best year to date, where he led the FBS in interceptions (five) after four weeks. Joseph flies into the backfield and attacks receivers in space like few others in this draft class, as he showed during his first-team All-Big 12 junior campaign (92 stops, 4.5 for loss, one interception, three pass break-ups, three forced fumbles.) Joseph started every game as a freshman (team defensive player of the year with 104 tackles, seven for loss, two interceptions, three forced fumbles) and sophomore (68 tackles, three for loss, one interception), as well, earning honorable mention all-conference recognition each season.",6.20
"It’s easy to mistake Killebrew for a linebacker, both because of his physique but also due to his hard hits. The four-year starter earned All-Big Sky recognition in each season: honorable mention in 2012 and 2013, second team in 2014, and first team in 2015. Killebrew reached the triple-digit mark in tackles the past two seasons (101 in 2014, 132 in 2015) and also showed an ability to handle his pass coverage responsibilities each year (three interceptions, one for a touchdown in 2014, seven pass break-ups in 2015). Killebrew was also named second team All-Big Sky last year after blocking two kicks. Special teams acumen and defensive productivity should earn him similar grades to FCS star safety Jaquiski Tartt (Samford), who was picked in the third round of the 2015 draft.",6.20
"Teams already know what to expect from Nick, as his brother Zack excelled in his first two seasons with Dallas after being selected in the first round in 2014. Nick will bring versatility along with the family toughness to an NFL team. He moves between center and guard without an issue (started at left guard 10 games in 2014, three games at center that year as well as most of 2013 and all of 2015), displaying a strong anchor in pass pro and nimble feet to attack linebackers in the run game. Teams envying the Cowboys' prodigious but athletic front line should consider picking up this Golden Domer.",6.20
"Miller was named third-team FCS All-American by The Associated Press as a junior, despite fighting through a dislocated shoulder that cost him three games. He then improved that honor to second-team AP All-American in 2015. Miller picked off 11 passes and broke up 22 others over the past three years using his height and length, earning first team All-Southland Conference honors each season. Miller also proved he could make plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage as a senior, making six tackles for loss, while additionally returning punts (15 for 175 yards), receiving first-team all-conference notice at that position. He looks to join former teammate Robert Alford (drafted in the second round by Atlanta in 2013) in the league.",6.20
"The native of Kenya has been impressive over the past three years when healthy, displaying pro-caliber footwork and a solid anchor in pass protection while earning All-Conference honors the past two years (second-team in 2014, first-team in 2015). However, Odhiambo (pronounced AH-dee-AHM-bo) has not been able to start more than nine games in any season due to injuries (he broke his ankle in this season’s ninth game). Still, whether he serves as an undersized tackle or proves strong enough to move inside (like former Boise State LT Daryn Colledge), Odhiambo has starter-quality skills.",6.20
"Seeing Perkins succeed as a college running back is not surprising, given that his father Bruce (whose first name is actually Paul) played fullback for two years in the NFL and his uncle Don played eight years for the Dallas Cowboys. His younger brother, Bryce, redshirted at Arizona State (where Bruce played) last year, as well. Living up to the family name can be challenging, but Perkins showed great promise as a redshirt freshman by starting six games and finishing as the team's top rusher after athletic quarterback Brett Hundley (134-573, six touchdowns). Hundley didn’t have to run as much in 2014, handing the ball to Perkins 251 times and watching the back go for a Pac-12 best 1,575 yards and nine touchdowns (plus 26 passes to Perkins for 201 yards and two scores). He somehow was only voted honorable mention all-conference for that performance, but coaches wised up in 2015, naming him to their second-team after another excellent season (1,343 yards, 14 TD rushing; 30-242, one TD receiving).",6.20
"Despite Robinson's athletic prowess, his ability to take advantage of those gifts, or to stay out of trouble, short-circuited his career in Gainesville. He was suspended four times with the Gators (twice in 2013), including once late in the 2015 season, to go along with two benchings in his final year on campus. The nephew of former South Carolina and NFL receiver Marcus Robinson, Demarcus was a major recruiting coup for the Gators as an all-state pick from Georgia. He played in only seven games as a freshman, though, due to two suspensions (5-23 receiving). Robinson took a step forward as a sophomore, catching 53 passes for 810 yards and seven touchdowns. His statistics dropped in 2015, however, as he played 13 games but could only manage 522 yards and two scores on 48 receptions as the Gators' offense struggled all season long.",6.20
"Shepard wears the same jersey number (3) as his late father, Derrick Shepard, who lettered for the Sooners as a receiver in the 1980s. Despite his slight frame, Shepard's toughness, strong hands, and quick cuts make him the sort of in-space player NFL offensive coordinators want working the middle of the field. Shepard’s production greatly increased from his second-team All-Big 12 2014 season (51 catches, 970 yards, five touchdowns) to his USA Today second-team All-American senior season (86-1,288-11).",6.20
"An absolute road grader, Turner has turned the heads of NFL general managers with his ability to move the line of scrimmage. The three-plus year starter at right guard followed up a third-team All-ACC junior campaign with an first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference senior year. The nephew of former NFL fullback Jim Braxton plays with the same tough mindset as his uncle.",6.20
"Vannett grew up in Westerville, Ohio, where OSU football is King. Though he was not utilized to his full potential in the Buckeyes’ passing attack, there’s no reason that he shouldn't be as valued as former teammate Jeff Heuerman, who was a 2015 third-round pick of the Denver Broncos. He has NFL size and hands, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten selection with 19 catches for 162 yards in 2015. Vannett had similar production (19-220) but more red zone targets (scoring five times) as a junior after spare usage as a redshirt freshman (two starts, 9-123) and sophomore (8-80, one TD).",6.20
"Westerman was a top national recruit who attended Auburn for his first two years, losing most of his redshirt freshman season due to injury before deciding to return to his home state of Arizona to finish his career. He excelled last fall in his first season as a starter for the Sun Devils, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice for his stout play and mobility at left guard. Westerman's play his senior campaign did not disappoint, as his attitude, stoutness, mobility, and solid technique made him a second-team all-conference performer.",6.20
"What do you do for an encore after winning the Lou Groza Award as the nation's top kicker? How about lead the nation in field goal percentage one year, and then become the first three-time All-American to play for the 'Noles since Deion Sanders? Not bad. Among his other accomplishments, Aguayo was a major player in the team’s 2013 national championship, setting FBS records with 157 points scored and 94 point after tries without a miss.  He also made 21-of-22 field goal attempts on the year.  The three-time first team All-ACC pick by league coaches set a conference record by making 198 straight extra points – every one in his storied career. Aguayo led the NCAA in field goal percentage in 2014, making 27-of-30 attempts, though he fell off a bit as a junior (21-26, just 5-for-10 from 40 or more yards away). He had 47 touchbacks in 84 kickoffs in 2015 (56 percent, up from 51 percent in 2014 and 37.5 percent in 2013), presenting leg strength NFL special teams coaches covet.",6.10
"Football is a family affair for the Alexanders. His father, Derrick, Sr., played at Oklahoma State and his brother, Derrick, Jr., is also heading toward an NFL career after excelling as a defensive lineman at Tulsa. Alexander's natural football acumen shone through in his first year with the Sooners, winning the Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year by starting the final eight games, making 80 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and forcing two fumbles. He started all 13 games each of the next two seasons, earning second-team All-Big 12 honors from the Associated Press in 2014 (107 tackles, six for loss, 1.5 sacks) and first-team all-conference accolades from coaches as a junior (103 tackles, seven for loss, 1.5 sacks). Even though he could have stayed at Oklahoma one more season, he decided to join his brother on the road to the next level.",6.10
"When an NFL offensive line coach sees that a young lineman was a high school wrestler, a smile comes across his face. Grappling in the trenches is what a lineman does -- and is something at which Allen excels. The former Illinois state title holder at 285 pounds is not the largest center in the country, but no other ""man in the middle"" matches this four-year starter's toughness, anchor, and aggressive nature. The two-time USA Today All-American missed a couple of games with an ankle injury in 2015, but came back to help his team to a Big Ten title.",6.10
"Blair was a second-team all-state pick in Georgia, but ended up at App. State instead of the SEC -– to the chagrin of the Mountaineers’ opponents. In his first three full years on the field (he missed most of 2013 with a thumb injury), he’s been an all-conference pick (two years in the FCS-level Southern Conference, 2014 in the Sun Belt) racking up 33 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks. Blair finished his career by winning the Sun Belt Conference’s Defensive Player of the Year (70 tackles, 19 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks), lining up outside and inside to take advantage of presented mismatches.",6.10

"Brissett's build (6-foot-4, 235), strong arm, and ability to pick up first downs with his feet will intrigue teams looking for a potential starter in a draft lacking great talent at the position. Brissett started his career at Florida, but transferred to N.C. State due to a recruiting relationship with head coach Dave Doeren. He’s started every game the past two years, shining against Florida State (32-for-48, 359 yards, three touchdowns) in 2014, which portended a nice senior year that saw him earn honorable mention All-ACC honors (2,662 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, six interceptions).",6.10

"Not only was Collins an outstanding football player at Kansas City Central High School (first-team all-state with 43 tackles for loss and 15 sacks as a senior), but a championship wrestler who won a state title at 48-0 in his final year. That combination is gold to NFL scouts, who love defensive linemen who have used their hands to grapple on the mat as well as the gridiron. Collins contributed in his first year on campus in 2013, playing all 12 games and starting the team's bowl game (12 tackles, two for loss, one sack). His star power began to shine in his sophomore year, garnering second team All-Big Ten accolades and team Defensive co-MVP with 45 tackles, 14 for loss, and 4.5 sacks. Though he started 12 of 13 games in 2015, Collins' production dropped: 29 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks. Big Ten media members and coaches alike still felt that he made enough plays to earn third-team all-conference honors.",6.10
"For three straight years, a member of the Boise State Broncos has left school early for the NFL Draft. Correa follows defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (picked by Dallas in the second round of the 2014 draft) and running back Jay Ajayi (fifth round, Miami, 2015). This year's early entrant is Correa, native of Honolulu, Hawai'i. He earned second-team All-Mountain West accolades in 2015, leading the Broncos with 11 tackles for loss and seven sacks on the year. Two of those sacks came in his last game with the Broncos, a win over Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl. Those numbers were actually down from Correa's sophomore year stats, when he was named first team all-conference after leading the Mountain West with 12 sacks and finishing third with 19 tackles for loss. In his true freshman year, 2013, he played in every game as a reserve (12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, sack).",6.10
"Day plays stronger than his measurements might indicate. Heady and hustling, he also holds his ground against double teams and may have the best hands of any lineman in the draft. Day played inside and outside for the Irish, regularly making plays in the backfield in 2015 (15.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, 13 quarterback hurries) on his way to USA Today first-team All-American honors. The three-year starter nearly matched his career tackle for loss total (16.5) and exceeded his sack total (3.5) despite being the focus of opposing offenses.",6.10
"Fuller was the fourth Fuller brother to suit up for Virginia Tech, and will be the fourth to play in the NFL, and probably the most talented of them all. Vincent played seven years in the league as a safety, Corey lines up as a reserve receiver for the Detroit Lions, and Kyle has played well at corner for Chicago after they made him a first-round pick in 2014. Kendall, a high school All-American, simply came into Bud Foster's defense as a true freshman, starting 12 games, intercepting six passes, and garnering Freshman All-American, second-team All-ACC and Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. Fuller continued to impress in his sophomore year, earning second team All-American notice from multiple outlets and first team all-conference nods from coaches and media alike (4.5 tackles for loss, two interceptions, 15 pass breakups) -- all while playing with a fractured wrist on which he had surgery after the season. Unfortunately, the injury bug bit Fuller again before the 2015 season, as he tore the meniscus in his right knee during preseason camp. He attempted to play through the injury, but decided to hang it up after three games (seven tackles, sack) to have it repaired. Rather than return to Virginia Tech after head coach Frank Beamer retired, Fuller decided to head to the next level as an early draft entrant to join his brothers.",6.10
"Left guard, right guard, center: wherever he lines up, Glasgow is a tough blocker that shows enough mobility to make creases for running backs. Glasgow started at right guard as a junior before moving into the pivot for 2015 after incumbent Jack Miller ended his football career due to concussions. Glasgow's nine starts there in 2013 made it an easier move, allowing him to lead a rejuvenated Michigan offense and garner consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors with his play.",6.10
"Though he spent more time playing Australian Rules football than American football growing up in Melbourne, Gotsis was a quick learner. He starred for a local club team before heading to Atlanta, and then played well as a true freshman against ACC competition. The 2014 consensus second-team all-conference pick is still raw, and played out of position as an interior lineman for Tech's defense considering his lack of bulk. He garnered 2015 third-team All-ACC accolades with 31 tackles, five for loss, and three sacks in nine games, but saw his season cut short with a November knee injury suffered against Virginia.",6.10
"This Georgia native had started 25 straight games at right guard for the Aztecs heading into the 2015 season and was poised to make a name for himself with NFL scouts. Greene made headlines for the wrong reason, however, as SDSU head coach Rocky Long suspended him along with four other players for six games after positive tests for marijuana. Contrite for his mistake, Greene came back to start the final seven games of the year, helping the team produce two 1000-yard rushers for the first time in school history. The 2014 honorable mention All-Mountain West selection will have to answer the same questions about the suspension again and again during the pre-draft process, but also has enough good tape to make teams take the time to consider his talent.",6.10

"Winning a job on LSU's offensive line is no easy task, as head coach Les Miles continually brings in large talents up front. But Hawkins managed to win the starting job at right tackle as a redshirt freshman, even playing on the blind side for an injured La'el Collins in one contest.  The Louisiana native started every game at right tackle in 2014, as well, before moving to Collins' left tackle spot this fall. He missed the contest against Ole Miss with an ankle injury, but started the other 12 games in his final season in Death Valley. Despite his pleas to Collins to stay for his senior season last year, Hawkins decided to forego his fourth year on campus to head to the NFL; he's the only Tiger to do so this year.",6.10
"Western Kentucky has had a bit of a run at the tight end position the past few years, with Jack Doyle drafted by the Colts in 2013 and Mitchell Henry getting his shot with multiple teams last summer. Higbee could be the best of the trio. The converted receiver added weight to his frame and when given the chance to show his stuff against Marshall as a junior, made six catches for 99 yards and three scores. He built on that in 2015, teaming up with two-time Conference USA MVP to put up some of the best numbers for any tight end in the country (38-563, eight TD) despite missing five-plus games with a knee injury.",6.10
"Houston-Carson's 2014 season ended early due to injury (67 tackles, three interceptions in nine games), but he returned to form in 2015 -- winning consensus All-American honors at free safety after starting for three years at cornerback. He has prototypical size and plenty of speed to make plays in the deep secondary, intercepting four passes, returning one for a 94-yard score in 2015. Houston-Carson also possesses secure tackling skills which helped him lead the team with 109 stops on the year (4.5 for loss). ""DHC"" started as a redshirt freshman (55 tackles, one interceptions, seven pass breakups) and sophomore (62 tackles, 4.5 TFL, 2 INT, 11 PBU), too. Houston-Carson also presents special-teams prowess, with nine career blocked kicks and working as a gunner on coverage units.",6.10
"Ioannidis (eye-an-NYE-dis) has been a valuable performer from the Owls since halfway through his freshman year, when the team took off his redshirt. Whether lined up outside or inside, his power and hustle impact nearly every play. The 2014 second-team All-American Athletic Conference pick (11 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks) and 2015 first-team All-Conference pick in 2015 (11.5 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, five pass break-ups) has added bulk to his frame every season.",6.10
"Jones' father, Cal, named his son after his favorite football player, Deion Sanders. His nickname has been ""Debo"", as in Deion and Bo, like Jackson, put together.  The New Orleans native is living up to the expectations, winning the Metro Defensive Player of the Year as a senior in high school and eventually starring for his home state LSU Tigers. Jones had to be patient, though, as his first three years in Baton Rouge resulted in exactly one start (due to an injury to Kwon Alexander). He played primarily on special teams in 2012 (23 tackles, three for loss) and 2013 (15 tackles) before seeing more time on defense as a junior (27 tackles, 3.5 for loss). Then came Jones’ chance to start with Alexander moving on to the NFL. He became permanent team captain and defensive MVP after leading the team with 100 tackles and 13.5 tackles for loss.  He also had five sacks, two interceptions, and three pass breakups, showing scouts an all-around skill set giving him a shot to play at the next level.",6.10
"This two-sport athlete experimented on the hardwood in 2012-13 before turning his full attention to the gridiron. The two-time first-team All-Independent pick had 15.5 career sacks entering the 2015 season, and added 11 more in an outstanding senior campaign while making 20 tackles for loss. Kaufusi’s size and athleticism have allowed Cougars coaches (of whom his father, Steve, is one) to play him standing up or hand-down during his career. NFL teams will have to decide where he fits best in their system.",6.10
"One of the more interesting stories in college football in 2015, Miller's descent from two-time Big Ten MVP to third-string passer could have ended badly. But after missing 2014 with a shoulder injury, Miller took on the challenge of switching to receiver for his senior year. Bragging that he was the ""best athlete in college football"", Miller looked prophetic with outstanding open-field moves and speed in the limited opportunities he received this season (24 catches, 329 yards, three TD receiving; 40 carries, 234 yards, one TD rushing). His elusiveness with the ball wasn’t surprising, as he had rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 2012 and 2013, but the natural hands he showed as a receiver make him an intriguing prospect.",6.10
"One of the better stories of the 2015 college football season, Nassib went from preferred walk-on status to two years of special teams play to leading the nation in sacks (school record 15.5) and forced fumbles (six) in his senior year. Nassib garnered unanimous All-American honors for his efforts(19.5 tackles for loss) while also winning the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, Lombardi Award as the nation's top offensive or defensive lineman, the Ted Hendricks Award for the nation's top defensive end, and the Lott IMPACT (Integrity, Maturity, Performance, Academics, Community, and Tenacity) Trophy. Nassib was also a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy for the player with the best career as a former walk-on, and the Nagurski Trophy as the nation's top defender.  Now scouts have to figure out if Nassib is a one-year wonder or a true star in the making.",6.10
"Prosise excelled in several ways for the Irish during his time in South Bend. Due to a lack of talent at the running back position, he was asked to tote the ball regularly in spring 2015 practices, running for 64 yards at the spring scrimmage. The Irish made him their leading rusher this fall, as he gained 1,032 yards and 11 scores on just 156 carries (6.6 average). Prosise also caught 26 passes and 308 yards and one touchdown -- but that was a role in which he had experience the past couple of seasons. He actually led all Irish receivers with 17.8 yards per reception in 2014 (29-516, two TD) and was also the team's Special Teams Player of the Year (11 tackles) and had a 50-yard rush for a touchdown in the Music City Bowl win over LSU. Prosise was actually recruited as a safety, but moved over to receiver for his redshirt freshman season in 2013, starting three times, catching seven passes for 72 yards.",6.10
"A four-star recruit from Memphis, Redmond got caught up in a recruiting mess that gave him and his family impermissible benefits. The NCAA investigated the situation, and did not allow him to play as a freshman at MSU. Redmond only played in eight games as a sophomore and didn't start a game for the Bulldogs in 2014 because of the depth they had at the position. Still, teams made a mistake throwing his way that year as he had a team-best three interceptions (along with five breakups) as a junior. Two of those interceptions sealed victories for Mississippi State in the fourth quarter. Once Redmond finally got the starting job as a senior (25 tackles, two INT, one PBU), he could only watch the second half of the season after tearing his right ACL in practice. But NFL teams won't forget the athleticism and toughness he showed in the 19 games he played in 2014-2015.",6.10
"The story of Russell's career at Notre Dame took a sharp left turn in August of 2014, as he and four of his teammates were suspended for academic improprieties. The prolonged investigative process cost him the 2014 season and 2014-15 school year, although he kept himself busy with community college courses, a job, and a strong workout program so he could return in 2015. He started 11 games for the Irish in his final season on campus, making 60 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and four pass breakups. Russell was actually considered one of the top running back recruits in the country coming out of high school, but moved to the secondary for the Irish before his freshman season. The move paid immediate dividends, as he started all 13 games earning Freshman All-American honors (58 tackles, two interceptions). Russell started every game again in 2013 (51 tackles, eight pass breakups), finishing strong with his lone interception of the year and three pass breakups against Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl.",6.10
"A two-time first-team All-Big 12 pick from Fort Worth, Texas, Sanchez has been a stalwart for the Sooners since taking the starting job as a redshirt freshman in 2013. He started 37 games over the past three years, missing two games this fall with a right leg injury. His slight frame worries scouts, and some questioned Sanchez's decision to leave early for the NFL, but there's no doubting his ability to play the ball (15 interceptions, 28 pass break-ups over the past three seasons). Sanchez received 2015 second team All-American notice from multiple outlets, as he not only picked off seven passes, but had 45 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and seven pass breakups.",6.10
"Spriggs excelled in his senior season, catching second-team All-Big Ten accolades along with the eyes of scouts. The four-year starter also was named first team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America and third-team honors by the Associated Press. Spriggs had a scary moment on the field in 2014 against Michigan State, as he was taken to the hospital after suffering a helmet-to-helmet blow. But since them he has shown the build (6-foot-7, 307 pounds), anchor in pass protection and willingness to block through the whistle to be the type of prospect NFL offensive line coaches will covet at left tackle.",6.10
"Thompson received All-American recognition in each of the past two seasons. After picking off seven passes in 2014, he added five more in just 11 games this season, totaling 19 for his career (tied for the most of any player in the country). But the 6-foot-2, 205-pound defender isn't just a ballhawk -- he is a physical presence in the secondary and solid tackler in space (242 career tackles) and behind the line of scrimmage (8.5 tackles for loss in 2015). Another impressive season in 2015, even though he missed the final two regular season games with a concussion, cemented his status as one of the best all-around safeties in the draft class.",6.10
"Going into the season, it appears this Trojan was on a path similar to the versatile Cameron Erving, the No. 19 overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2015 draft. Tuerk has started at nearly every place along the line for the Trojans. He is a bit taller and more slender than most pro pivots, but that may still be his best spot given that he used his mobility and tenacity to earn first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2014. Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in October and will have to prove himself before the draft to maximize his grades.",6.10
"Considering that Jihad (pronounced juh-HODD) Ward went from receiver/safety to the defensive line during his time in junior college, the sky's the limit once he really knows what to do with his size and strength. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by league coaches (51 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, four fumble recoveries) in his first season with the Illini, playing inside and outside and using his huge wingspan to swallow ball carriers. Ward, who wears jersey number 17 because that was his mother’s age when he was born, didn’t have the same production as a senior (3.5 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks) but still earned honorable mention notice due to his strong play.",6.10
NA,NA
"Washington showed himself ready to play for his senior season by racking up four sacks in Ohio State's spring game. Following up an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior season (10.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks), played even better in 2015. He earned second-team All-Conference honors from league coaches and media, as well as first-team All-American by the Sporting News (49 tackles, seven for loss, four sacks). Unfortunately, his judgment and maturity may be questioned by scouts after he was suspended for Ohio State's bowl game for soliciting a vice squad officer in early December.",6.10
"White made one of the more impressive plays of the 2014 season when he used his speed to chase down Pitt star running back James Conner on a 74-yard run to knock the ball out just before they reached the end zone. That hustle combined with his ability to make plays in coverage turned White into an honorable mention All-ACC selection in 2014 (team-best four interceptions, eight pass breakups). He played well again as a senior (41 tackles, two interceptions, eight pass breakups), making himself a coveted prospect at a prime position.",6.10
"Williams was a second-team all-conference performer in 2014 with 1,190 yards and 12 touchdowns rushing, despite the fact that he shared carries with junior Alex Collins for the second straight year (he had 900 yards and four touchdowns as a sophomore). Williams missed the 2015 regular season after undergoing foot surgery, but decided he was better off entering the league instead of taking advantage of a redshirt (he played 11 games, starting two, as a true freshman). The thickly built and athletic Williams has the strength to return from this injury and excel as an NFL rookie.",6.10
"Adams took over as the primary target after Rory Anderson went down with an injury in 2014 and excelled, using his height and strider's speed to finish with 21 catches for 279 yards and one score on the year. Even in a year in which the Gamecocks struggled to move the ball through the air (they ranked in the bottom quarter of the FBS), he set career highs with 28 catches for 421 yards and three touchdowns. The former star high school basketball player has the physical skills to excel as a receiver and blocker in the NFL.",5.90
"Addison was a first-team all-state quarterback in Texas his senior year, but it was clear his collegiate future was at the receiver position.  He played wideout in the U.S. Army All-American game, and didn't miss a beat once in Eugene, making 22 catches for 243 yards and three scores as a true freshman. After fully adjusting to the college game, his sophomore season effort earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades as a receiver (61-890, seven TD) and also averaged 14.1 yards per punt return, scoring twice. Addison’s ascension to the top of the college football world hit a roadblock in the spring of 2014, however, as he tore his ACL during a practice.  The roadblock proved to be just a hiccup, though, as he returned to his explosive self in 2015, garnering second-team All-Pac-12 honors (63-804, 10 TD receiving; 12.6 average, one TD on punt returns) before deciding to take his quickness to the NFL.",5.90
"After starting for two years next to La'el Collins at left guard (earning second-team All-SEC honors as a junior), Alexander moved back to right tackle (where he earned freshman All-American honors in starting the final seven games in 2012) for his senior year. He played well enough on the outside to earn first-team All-SEC honors in 2015. Alexander shed at least 30 pounds since arriving on campus, giving him a shot to stay at tackle when he arrives in the NFL. Otherwise, he projects as a powerful inside player.",5.90
"A three-year starter for the Razorbacks, Allen really came on in the second half of his senior year to open the eyes of scouts. In fact, the Fayetteville native, son of the school's director of high school and NFL relations, and one-time Arkansas High School Player of the Year improved each year. He completed less than 50 percent of his passes for 1,552 yards and 13 touchdowns as a sophomore, hit 56 percent of his passes for 2,285 yards and 20 scores in 2014, and then connected on 66 percent of throws in 2015 for 3,340 yards and 30 touchdowns (against just eight interceptions). This improvement isn't lost on the eyes of NFL teams.",5.90
"At the end of Beavers' redshirt freshman year, Broncos coaches did something they wouldn't regret: start him at left tackle. He's been a stalwart on the blind side ever since (40 straight games), playing with a strong base, good feet, and excellent tenacity as a pass protector and run blocker. The 2015 first-team All-MAC (second team in 2014) pick’s size is only average, at best, for a tackle, but he'll get his shot.",5.90
"One of the top offensive line recruits in the country coming out of high school, Boehm stepped right onto the field for the Tigers in 2012 -- and hasn’t left the lineup since. He started 52 straight games for head coach Gary Pinkel, playing freshman year at left guard and then three straight years in the pivot. Boehm is a thick interior lineman who has a strong anchor and can move his feet well for the position, portending a long NFL career.",5.90
"Boehringer played for the Schwbisch Hall Unicorns of the German Football League. In the 2015 season, Boehringer had 59 receptions for 1,232 yards and 13 touchdowns in 16 games played.",5.90

"The Boilermakers had one of the worst pass defenses in college football in 2015, but Brown shouldn't be blamed for that performance. He intercepted four passes on the year (the first four of his career), breaking up six others (giving him 19 in three years as a starter). One of Brown's strengths is his tackling ability (110 in 2014-2015), as he's willing to throw his body into a play. Combining good athleticism with some physicality makes Brown a potential special teams contributor and reserve corner at the next level.",5.90
"The former top national recruit went from a solid contributor (29 catches, 358 yards, one score) as a junior to a big-time playmaker for quarterback Connor Cook and the Spartans in 2015. Burbridge was named the Big Ten Receiver of the Year as a senior, as well as first-team all-conference by league coaches and media after nabbing 85 catches for 1,258 yards (with seven touchdowns). Both those figures led the Big Ten, becoming just the second Spartans player to lead the conference in that category (Kirk Gibson in 1976 and 1978). When Cook went back to pass, his first, second and third looks were to Burbridge as he trusted his teammate to make the clutch third-down catch as well as high-point the deep ball.",5.90
"Burris has been an excellent performer, physical and reliable, since his redshirt freshman season for the Wolfpack. The defensive back made five starts at the nickel spot that first year, playing in every game and intercepting three passes on the year (also with 43 tackles, eight pass break-ups.) In year two, Burris became a full-time starter (53 tackles, interception, 11 PBU). His stats dropped a bit in his junior year (29 tackles, one INT, five PBU) but rebounded a bit in 2015 (38 tackles, three TFL, one INT, seven PBU).",5.90
"Cajuste is a similar prospect to the Carolina Panthers' second-round pick last April, Devin Funchess. Both have large receiver builds that can create mismatches in goal-line situations and in the middle of the field. Though he didn’t duplicate his outstanding junior year (34 catches, 557 yards, six scores -- two against Maryland in the Foster Farms Bowl) in 2015, a lack of opportunities seemed the most likely reason for his 27-reception, 383-yard, three-touchdown effort. Against Notre Dame in November, however, Cajuste showed his real potential by catching five passes for 125 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinal's rival.",5.90
"Coker was inconsistent, at best, this season as the starter for the Crimson Tide after getting on the field in just 17 games while at Florida State (2011-2013) and his first year at Alabama. Coker backed up first round pick E.J. Manuel in 2012 and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston in 2013, seeing limited time. He could not beat out veteran Blake Sims for the starting job once arriving in Tuscaloosa, though he did play a bit (38-59, 64.4 percent, 403 yards, four TD, no INT in 7 games).  But as Coker's first year as a starter progressed, there was improvement that NFL teams undoubtedly noticed. He won Offensive MVP honors in the Cotton Bowl win over Michigan State (25-30, 286 yards, two TD), which sent the Tide to the national title game against Clemson. Coker passed for a career-high 335 yards, connecting with tight end O.J. Howard for two scores, helping Alabama win its fourth title in seven years.",5.90
"One of the most productive players in the Football Championship Subdivision in 2014 (28.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks in 2014), Cowser used strong hands and a great motor to beat tackles again in his senior campaign (19 tackles for loss, 13 sacks, four forced fumbles). In fact, he set FCS records for career sacks (42.5) and tackles for loss (80) last season, his second straight season garnering All-American notice from the Walter Camp Foundation, the Associated Press, and other outlets. Cowser is a bit older than the typical draft prospect because he redshirted at SUU in 2009 before heading to a two-year LDS church mission. Combining that maturity with strength, intensity and production makes for an intriguing prospect.",5.90
"After spending one year at the University of Montana and another sitting out as a transfer student, Dahl stepped into the starting lineup for the Cougars and hasn't left. He was the team’s left guard for the 2013 regular season before moving out to left tackle for the bowl game –- his home for the past two seasons. It’s no surprise head coach/offensive mad genius Mike Leach can pass 50 times a game with minimal pressure given Dahl's ability to lock down the quarterback’s blind side with good lateral movement and a solid anchor. Despite earning first-team All-Pac-12 and USA Today second-team All-American accolades at left tackle in 2015, NFL scouts will want Dahl moved inside at the next level due to his average size and length. Either way, he’ll be a worthy pick as a potential starter.",5.90
"Davis speaks English, French, Chinese ... and the language of pain. At least that's what opposing ball carriers feel as he flies into them with reckless abandon. He was credited with more than 100 tackles in both his sophomore and junior seasons, and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media by making 88 tackles, intercepting three passes, and ranking among the FBS leaders in forced fumbles with five in 2015. His versatility will certainly be coveted by NFL scouts, as will his athleticism, height/length, and tenacious play.",5.90
"Drake's explosiveness as an all-purpose weapon is somewhat tempered by his injury history. He suffered a broken leg against Ole Miss in 2014, and then fractured his right arm trying to make a tackle on special teams this fall. Drake did return a couple of weeks after that injury, however, and flashed his slashing style (averaged six yards a carry for his career). He also provides good hands out of the backfield (12.5 yards per reception). He showed in the national championship game he can be a threat as a kickoff returner, taking one back 95 yards for a crucial score. A healthy Drake could be a great find in the mid-to-late rounds.",5.90
"Thankfully Fairbairn only goes by Ka'imi, because his full first name is a mouthful: Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a. Fairbairn was the first Bruin to total over 100 points in each of his four collegiate seasons, saving his best season for last. The 2015 Lou Groza Award winner connected on 20 of 24 attempts in 2015, improving from his 18-for-22 mark in 2014. Fairbairn made two of three attempts from 50 yards out or more, including a 60-yarder against Cal. His ability to force touchbacks on kickoffs also catches the eyes of scouts (119 of 164 in 2014-2015, or 72.6 percent). A dual threat like that is coveted by special teams coaches across the league, making this Hawaii native a wanted man.",5.90
"Frazier garnered second-team All-MAC recognition in his senior season (led team with 108 tackles, 4.5 for loss), but the largest honor he received was being able to wear the No. 21 jersey of his former friend and teammate, Derrick Nash. Nash passed away from leukemia in June 2015, and coaches decided to rotate the 21 jersey throughout the season as a way of honoring his memory. Frazier got to wear the jersey twice, including in the team's bowl game. Before 2015, Frazier played as a reserve in 2012 (36 tackles, one interception, three pass breakups), earned more playing time as a sophomore (67 tackles, three interceptions, five pass breakups), and went back to a partial starter in 2014 (58 stops, four pass break-ups).",5.90
"Like many players on major college football powers, Goodson rose up the ranks during his career, waiting for others to graduate or move on to the NFL before being able to show off his full skill set. He was no slouch coming from the same high school as former Clemson and NFL standout linebacker Levon Kirkland, though Goodson's game is not similar to that of his boyhood hero. After two years as a reserve (11 tackles in 2012-2013), Goodson became a co-starter at linebacker as a redshirt sophomore, making 34 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and three recovered fumbles. He took the reins of the defense in his senior season, leading the Tigers with 108 tackles, 14 of which resulted in losses including 5.5 sacks. Goodson displayed an excellent all-around game, intercepting two passes, breaking up three others, and forcing a fumble during the year to garner third-team All-ACC honors from league coaches (second-team from league media).",5.90

"Green was a lightly-regarded two-star recruit out of Alabama when Clemson made a scholarship offer -- one of only two major programs to do so. Even though the other was his favorite school growing up, Auburn, he took a chance on Clemson, and it paid off well. He worked at the receiver position as a true freshman, catching two passes and returning three kicks in 12 games. Coaches moved him to safety after the season, with the hopes he could make a bigger impact -- figuratively and literally. As a sophomore he started once and played as a reserve in 10 other contests, recording 24 tackles and one interception, in addition to returning kicks full-time (445 yards). His game took a big leap in 2015, as Green and his roommate, Jayron Kearse, formed one of the tallest and most feared safety duos in the country. He finished second on the team with 95 tackles, 5.5 for loss, broke up three passes and forced two fumbles as the Tigers run at an undefeated season went all the way to the final game of the year.",5.90
"Hall's head coach, Mark Farley, has stated that Hall could play any position on defense because of his good attitude, football intelligence, and tenacious nature. He started at safety as a freshman, played as a lean rover at times his sophomore year, and then moved to the outside later that year before starring at the position in 2014 (racking up 74 tackles and five picks). Farley and his defensive coaches moved Hall between corner and safety in 2015, and he saw success in both spots, earning multiple All-American honors and the Missouri Valley Football Conference Defensive Player of the Year award with 82 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and three forced fumbles. He also returned two of his league-best six interceptions for touchdowns, giving him a school-record four ""pick sixes"" in his career.",5.90
"A bit overshadowed playing in Fort Collins, Higgins was simply one of the most productive players in college football the past two seasons. The school's all-time leader in receptions (239), receiving yards (3,649) and receiving touchdowns (31). He actually had his worst season in 2015 with a new offense and a new quarterback (75-1,062, 8 TD) but was still a first team All-Mountain West selection. His 2014 season was phenomenal, garnering consensus All-American and first team all-conference honors with 96 catches (10th in the FBS) for a nation-leading 1,750 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Biletnikoff Award finalist's 17 touchdowns averaged 35 yards each. The honorable mention all-Texas pick became an immediate starter for the Rams in 2013, leading the team with 68 catches for 837 yards and six touchdowns.",5.90
"Jones went from relative unknown (outside Ohio) to superstar to backup during his tumultuous Buckeyes career. He signed with Ohio State a semester early after a stellar at career powerhouse Glenville (coached by Ted Ginn, Sr.), redshirted in 2012 and played just 39 plays from scrimmage in 2013 (1-3 passing, 17-128, one TD rushing). But when Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett were lost to injury before and during the 2015 season, respectively, it was Jones’ turn to shine. He came in for Barrett to finish off Michigan, beat down Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then led the Buckeyes to a national title a month later.  Jones finished the year completing 60.0 percent of his throws for 860 yards and seven touchdowns against two interceptions, as well as rushing for 296 yards and a score. Head Coach Urban Meyer named Jones the starter after a heated battle between he and Barrett, but Jones’ inconsistency caused him to lose the job to Barrett halfway through the season (eight starts, 1,460 passing yards, 62.5 percent on completions, eight TD, five INT; 193 yards, two TD rushing). With Barrett returning for another year in 2016, Jones decided to enter the NFL draft as an early entrant rather than finishing his career at another college.",5.90
"Jones switched from receiver to cornerback for his sophomore campaign in 2013, and then blossomed into a second-team All-SEC pick by league media in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass deflections) in spite of a torn labrum in his hip, which was surgically repaired in the offseason. He started all 15 games his senior year, improving in coverage (two INT, seven PBU) and putting to rest concerns about his hip. Teams might be more interested in him as a punt returner, though, as his four touchdowns on a nation-leading 42 attempts in 2015 (12.6 yard average) came up one short of tying the FBS record. A domestic violence charge that was dropped against him last spring will make teams take a hard look at his character references.",5.90
"Nearly every year, at least one punter hears his name called in the top 200 picks; it could be Kaser in 2016 because he possesses a quick delivery as well as the leg strength and hang time to consistently change field position. He was an All-American and Ray Guy Award finalist in 2013 after leading the SEC with a 47.4-yard average (beating perennial Pro Bowler Shane Lechler's school record), and had nice follow-up seasons in 2014 (44.5-yard average, 19-of-56 punts inside the 20). Kaser broke that school record again in 2015 (47.47) on his way to first team All-SEC honors, placing 21 of 60 punts inside the 20-yard line. He also threatened the SEC career record with a 46.2 career gross average.",5.90
"Clemson may have locked up Kearse as a recruit by giving him the choice of playing safety or receiver once arriving on campus. Not only did he prefer the physical aspects of the game in spite of his frame, but he also has some excellent family resources to access on the defensive side of the ball; his uncle is former Florida and NFL pass rusher extraordinaire Jevon Kearse and cousin is former Miami and NFL star cornerback Phillip Buchanon. He started just three games in his freshman season, playing in 12, but still managed to make 55 tackles and tie for the team lead with four interceptions. Kearse started at safety his sophomore campaign (67 stops, five for loss, three sacks, two interceptions) and continued that success in a first-team All-ACC junior season (62 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one interception, six pass break-ups). The Associated Press voted him second team All-American in 2015, as well, as he joined a bevy of talented defenders and Heisman hopeful quarterback Deshaun Watson in putting together an undefeated regular season and national championship game appearance.",5.90

"Physically, there's nothing special about Kessler; he possesses average size, an adequate arm, and fair athleticism (though he can effectively move within the pocket, which is important). The three-year starter could never crack Pac-12 first or second all-conference teams from league coaches, thrice finishing in the honorable mention category. However, Kessler was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award the past two years because he moves the offense efficiently (3,826 yards, completed 69.7 percent of his passes; 3,536, 66.8 percent in 2015) and doesn’t turn the ball over much (39 touchdowns, five interceptions in 2014; 29 TD, 7 INT in 2015). In fact, Kessler owns the school record for career completion percentage at 67.5.",5.90
"Latham is a product of Indianapolis' North Central High School, where he starred as a football and basketball player, and decided to sign on with his home state team despite being a top 20 defensive tackle recruit nationally. The team made room for their prized recruit on the field immediately, as he played in all 12 games as a regular in the rotation (22 tackles, three for loss, two sacks, three pass break-ups). Latham made some plays in his sophomore year (10 starts, 26 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks) but turned up his game a bit in his junior year. He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors after making 33 tackles, 10 for loss, and four sacks during 2015. However, NFL scouts evaluating the early entrant will take heed that Latham was twice suspended for one game due to violating team rules.",5.90
"Lawler and quarterback Jared Goff made a great combination for Cal, helping the Bears increase their win total from one to eight over the past three seasons. As a redshirt freshman, tied for the team lead with five touchdown catches among his 37 receptions for 347 yards. Goff and Lawler left for the NFL after a strong 2015 season for both, with Lawler voted a first-team All-Pac-12 pick with 52 catches, 658 yards, and 13 touchdowns (ranking in the top ten nationally). He finished his Cal career with three touchdowns against Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl.",5.90

"A size-speed prospect, Lee's ability to stretch the field has worked perfectly in Art Briles' prolific Baylor offense. He stepped up his game as a junior, catching 41 passes for 633 yards and six touchdowns and even throwing a 53-yard touchdown pass to Corey Coleman in the Cotton Bowl against Michigan State. Lee became an even bigger part of the Bears’ nation-leading offense in 2015, averaging nearly 20 yards per catch using his striding speed and scoring eight touchdowns. Lee was a nice foil to Coleman this fall, a role he'll likely play at the next level.",5.90

"As a five-star recruit set to play in his home state, Marshall faced high expectations from Buckeyes fans. His transition from spectacular dual-threat quarterback to wide receiver was not immediate, however, as he redshirted the 2013 season due to injuries (including a concussion). He then tore a meniscus in spring practice, slowing his development a bit more. The payoff came in the team's national championship season of 2014, as he played in all 15 games as a reserve and was the team's second-leading receiver with 38 catches for 499 yards and six scores. Those freshman-year numbers, which were second only to Hall of Fame receiver Cris Carter in OSU's storied history, gained him Freshman All-American accolades. Marshall was also second on the team in receiving in 2015 and receiving honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a receiver (36-477, five TD) and punt returner (28-379), before deciding to head to the next level.",5.90
"One of the strongest players in college football, McGovern has broken weight room records at Mizzou (like a 690-pound squat) and actually tore his pectoral muscle trying to bench 515 pounds. The Gatorade High School Player of the Year in North Dakota in 2010, McGovern's not just all muscle. He's started for three years at right guard, right tackle, and then left tackle as a senior. Though McGovern was solid for the Tigers at tackle, scouts consider him a better interior prospect due to that strength and his underrated movement skills. He hopes to move up boards throughout the process, just like his teammate, Mitch Morse, who was picked in the mid-second round by Kansas City in the 2015 draft.",5.90
"In August, Mills fractured his left fibula (leg) and tore ligaments in his ankle. So he took a redshirt year, right? Wrong. He came back to play in six games, starting the final five at nickelback or safety (30 tackles, sack, three pass breakups). Mills' toughness wasn’t surprising given his strength as a tackler (62 stops in 2014) and the hands to create turnovers consistently (six interceptions in his first three years). LSU is known for the talent in their secondary, but that didn't stop Mills from starting at cornerback as a true freshman (57 tackles, two INT, five PBU) after Tyrann Mathieu was dismissed from the team.  Though scouts will love his versatility, they have questions about an arrest for second-degree battery of a woman in the summer of 2014 (the charges were eventually reduced to a misdemeanor and he was assigned to a diversion program).",5.90
"This two-time second-team All-SEC pick is undersized, but extremely productive; he hit triple digits in tackles in 2014 (101) and 2015 (103, leading the team), and doubled his impact in the backfield between those two seasons, going from six to 12 tackles for loss. The fact he played at all this fall was a tribute to his work ethic, as he came back from undergoing multiple surgeries on his left knee to repair an injury from the 2014 Birmingham Bowl. However, teams will have to check into his background due to two arrests (punching bouncer, barking at a police dog/resisting arrest) within five weeks in the summer of 2013. If he can convince general managers that his hard times are behind him, they'll bank on his talent.",5.90
"Born in Washington, D.C., Ngakoue stayed nearby for college after an excellent high school career. He was named the D.C. Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, racking up 17 sacks and leading Friendship Collegiate to a district title. Nkagoue got his feet wet as a true freshman, making 10 tackles, 4.5 for loss including two sacks, and an interception playing every game as a reserve. His play as a sophomore earned honorable mention notice from league media (37 tackles, 13.5 for loss and six sacks) and portended better things to come. Quarterbacks in the Big Ten did not appreciate his improvement in what proved to be his final collegiate season -- he set a Maryland record and finished tied for second in the country with 13.5 sacks (within 15 total tackles for loss).",5.90
"Norris hopes to be the next Ute end/linebacker to enter the NFL (recent draftees include Joe and Paul Kruger, Koa Misi, Nate Orchard and Trevor Reilly). He played as a reserve as a redshirt freshman before starting seven games the following year (64 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks). Norris came into his own as a junior, receiving honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors  with 116 tackles, 13 for loss, and four sacks. Even though his statistics weren't as impressive in 2015 (87 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one sack), league coaches named him second team all-conference because he showed stoutness between the tackles and a burst to the ball which portends a solid NFL career.",5.90

"Perry gained respect from Big Ten coaches for his play as a senior, garnering first team All-Big Ten notice with 105 tackles, 7.5 for loss and three sacks. He also received honors for his leadership and character, being named an all-state AFCA All-Good Works Team member, as well as a finalist for the Lott IMPACT, Senior CLASS Award, and the Wuerffel Trophy. The Buckeyes' leading tackler in 2014 (124, 8.5 for loss, three sacks) earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors in his second year as a starter (he had 64 tackles, two for loss the previous year). Though not a highly recruited player like many on head coach Urban Meyer's squad, Perry's list of national honors speaks volumes about his willingness to do what it takes to get the job done.",5.90
"Powell just seems to make big plays in big games. He intercepted Michigan's two-point attempt to win the rivalry game as a redshirt freshman in 2013, He picked off a Hail Mary attempt by Alabama in the 2014 college football semifinal, ensuring the Buckeyes could go on to win the championship – where he won Defensive MVP honors against Oregon (game-high nine tackles, pass break-up). Then he intercepted yet another pass in Ohio State’s win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. After that contest, Powell (who graduated in three and a half years) decided to take his game to the NFL.  He played in all 14 games in that redshirt freshman season, starting five times (48 tackles, one interception). Earning the full-time starter spot in 2014, Powell made 76 tackles, two for loss, while intercepting four passes and breaking up four others. His play as a junior merited honorable mention All-Big Ten honors from coaches and media, as he led the Buckeyes with three interceptions and made 71 tackles on the year.",5.90
"Rayne Dakota ""Dak"" Prescott proved himself to be an excellent college quarterback in 2014, breaking all sorts of school records (4,435 yards of total offense, 27 touchdown passes, 61.6 completion percentage), named a finalist for the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Unitas Golden Arm awards and helping his team to a 10-3 record. The two-time first team All-SEC pick ended up with 38 MSU records after a senior year where he won the Senior CLASS Award as the top scholar-athlete on and off the field. Prescott led the team in passing (3,793 yards, 66.2 completion percentage, 29 TD, five INT) and rushing (588 yards, 10 scores) for the second straight year in 2015, joining Tim Tebow as the only two players in SEC history to accomplish that feat. Prescott got on the radar as a redshirt freshman in 2012, playing as a red-zone quarterback, scoring four times as a passer and four as a runner. The next year, he started seven games in two-quarterback system (Tyler Russell), throwing with 1,940 yards, and 10 touchdowns (seven INT), missing two games with an elbow injury.",5.90
