       " Document(page_content=\"Fields was Mr. Football in Georgia as a senior at Harrison High School, so it was natural for him to accept UGA's offer as one of the top recruits in the country. He appeared in 12 games as a true freshman, playing behind Jake Fromm (27-of-39, 69.2%, 328 yards, four TDs passing; 42-266-6.3, four TDs rushing) and earning a spot on the SEC All-Freshman Team. He decided to move on to Ohio State in January 2019, as Fromm was expected to start again that year. Fields was granted a waiver from the NCAA that allowed him to play immediately for the Buckeyes. He earned Heisman Trophy finalist, second-team Associated Press All-American and Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year honors as a sophomore, ranking third in the country in touchdown throws (41, against just three interceptions) and fourth in passing efficiency rating (181.4) in 14 starts. He was named MVP of the Big Ten Championship Game after throwing for 299 yards and three TDs in a win over Wisconsin before losing to Clemson in the national semifinals. Fields was quite familiar with Tigers quarterback Trevor Lawrence as they grew up 20 miles apart in Georgia and were considered the top two prospects in the 2018 recruiting class. Fields took Ohio State a step closer to a national title in 2020, winning Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year for the second straight season. He finished the year ranked sixth in the country in completion percentage (158-of-225, 70.2%, 2,100 yards, 22 TDs, six INTs passing) and rushed for five scores (81-383-4.7) in eight starts. His postseason efforts as a passer were up and down. He struggled against Northwestern in the team's Big Ten Championship Game victory (12-of-27, 44.4%, 114 yards, 2 INTs), bounced back while playing through injury in the semifinal win over Clemson (22-of-28, 78.6%, 385 yards, six TDs, one INT), and then came up short against Alabama in the title game (17-of-33, 51.5%, 194 yards, one TD).
