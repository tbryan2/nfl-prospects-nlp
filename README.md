## Introduction
Football analytics in the modern era is highly sophisticated. The NFL uses player tracking to measure speed and movement, teams dedicate entire departments to analytics and analysis, and there are even entire Python and R libraries dedicated to advanced performance metrics. 

However, there's still an aspect to the game that's based on qualitative data generated by experienced professionals (scouts, player development). The complexity and stocastic nature of football keeps the qualitative data valuable - there are things that numbers simply cannot reveal about how a player performs. It's what keeps people like this employed (*Moneyball*, 2011):
